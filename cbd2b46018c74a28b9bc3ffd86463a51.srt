00:00:00.250 --> 00:00:02.700
- It's called big data
because it is more data

2
00:00:02.700 --> 00:00:04.350
than a human can wrangle,

3
00:00:04.350 --> 00:00:07.050
has more attributes
than a human can manage,

4
00:00:07.050 --> 00:00:10.910
and more permutations than
the human mind can comprehend.

5
00:00:10.910 --> 00:00:12.890
But machine learning is so powerful,

6
00:00:12.890 --> 00:00:16.410
because it is so good at
dimensionality and cardinality.

7
00:00:16.410 --> 00:00:17.580
Let me break it down

8
00:00:17.580 --> 00:00:20.600
so you will know when machine
learning would be useful,

9
00:00:20.600 --> 00:00:22.760
what kinds of problems
it's good at solving,

10
00:00:22.760 --> 00:00:24.010
and you'll be able to tell

11
00:00:24.010 --> 00:00:25.830
when some so-called data scientist

12
00:00:25.830 --> 00:00:28.180
is trying to pull the wool over your eyes.

13
00:00:28.180 --> 00:00:29.820
You've got a lot of data.

14
00:00:29.820 --> 00:00:31.820
Let's say you have a
hundred thousand customers

15
00:00:31.820 --> 00:00:32.990
or even a million.

16
00:00:32.990 --> 00:00:33.920
That's great.

17
00:00:33.920 --> 00:00:36.760
You can't keep a million
customers in your head,

18
00:00:36.760 --> 00:00:39.770
but an Excel spreadsheet
can manage that just fine.

19
00:00:39.770 --> 00:00:41.360
So let's make it harder.

20
00:00:41.360 --> 00:00:45.580
Let's say you know a thousand
things about a million people,

21
00:00:45.580 --> 00:00:48.810
that's a thousand columns
of things that you know

22
00:00:48.810 --> 00:00:51.910
in a database with a
million rows of customers.

23
00:00:51.910 --> 00:00:53.360
If you want to know how many customers

24
00:00:53.360 --> 00:00:54.860
are in a given zip code,

25
00:00:54.860 --> 00:00:58.070
how many of those are
subscribed to your email list

26
00:00:58.070 --> 00:01:01.560
and have purchased from you
in the past three months,

27
00:01:01.560 --> 00:01:03.510
spreadsheet can still handle that.

28
00:01:03.510 --> 00:01:05.090
But if you wanted to know

29
00:01:05.090 --> 00:01:07.470
what other patterns
are present in the data

30
00:01:07.470 --> 00:01:10.670
without you having to come
up with a specific question,

31
00:01:10.670 --> 00:01:12.740
you could ask an infinite
number of interns

32
00:01:12.740 --> 00:01:14.590
to look at the data and cross-reference it

33
00:01:14.590 --> 00:01:16.510
six ways to Sunday for months

34
00:01:16.510 --> 00:01:19.260
and they might not come up
with something interesting.

35
00:01:19.260 --> 00:01:22.800
But machine learning can
easily handle tens of thousands

36
00:01:22.800 --> 00:01:25.470
of columns about millions of customers.

37
00:01:25.470 --> 00:01:27.500
That's dimensionality.

38
00:01:27.500 --> 00:01:32.310
Each column holds a thing that
you know about each customer,

39
00:01:32.310 --> 00:01:33.740
that's a dimension.

40
00:01:33.740 --> 00:01:37.330
And you get to tens of thousands
of things when you add in

41
00:01:37.330 --> 00:01:39.890
behavioral data like social media activity

42
00:01:39.890 --> 00:01:42.470
and website visits and past
purchase and what they said

43
00:01:42.470 --> 00:01:45.430
when they call the call center and so on.

44
00:01:45.430 --> 00:01:48.330
Lots of dimensions about each person.

45
00:01:48.330 --> 00:01:50.090
Then comes cardinality,

46
00:01:50.090 --> 00:01:53.240
which is a fancy word for the
number of possible entries

47
00:01:53.240 --> 00:01:55.190
in each dimension.

48
00:01:55.190 --> 00:01:56.790
Take age for example,

49
00:01:56.790 --> 00:01:59.070
the number of possible
entries in the age field

50
00:01:59.070 --> 00:02:03.030
is somewhere between zero
and 122, so far as we know.

51
00:02:03.030 --> 00:02:04.610
Do they live in California?

52
00:02:04.610 --> 00:02:07.960
Ah, only two possible
answers there, yes or no,

53
00:02:07.960 --> 00:02:09.870
really low cardinality.

54
00:02:09.870 --> 00:02:11.610
But what's their phone number?

55
00:02:11.610 --> 00:02:14.280
If half the people on the
planet have their own phone,

56
00:02:14.280 --> 00:02:18.360
there are 4 billion possibilities
for that one field alone,

57
00:02:18.360 --> 00:02:19.940
that one dimension.

58
00:02:19.940 --> 00:02:23.510
Think about your spreadsheet
as having lots and lots of rows

59
00:02:23.510 --> 00:02:24.790
and lots and lots of columns.

60
00:02:24.790 --> 00:02:26.410
The rows are the objects of the people,

61
00:02:26.410 --> 00:02:28.350
the columns are the
dimensions or the attributes

62
00:02:28.350 --> 00:02:29.610
of what you know about them.

63
00:02:29.610 --> 00:02:33.010
And cardinality is all about
how many possible options

64
00:02:33.010 --> 00:02:35.120
there are in a given dimension.

65
00:02:35.120 --> 00:02:37.890
With data that's that rich and that deep,

66
00:02:37.890 --> 00:02:41.390
you need something seriously
powerful to deal with it.

67
00:02:41.390 --> 00:02:43.870
And that's where machine learning shines.

68
00:02:43.870 --> 00:02:47.010
So I want you to get to
know your company's data.

69
00:02:47.010 --> 00:02:49.640
Where is your company now
regarding dimensionality

70
00:02:49.640 --> 00:02:50.870
and cardinality?

71
00:02:50.870 --> 00:02:53.230
What additional data could you add

72
00:02:53.230 --> 00:02:54.960
that will open up more doors?

73
00:02:54.960 --> 00:02:57.250
How can you better understand and expand

74
00:02:57.250 --> 00:03:00.240
your data's dimensionality
and cardinality?

75
00:03:00.240 --> 00:03:01.073
Keep this in mind

76
00:03:01.073 --> 00:03:04.180
when it's time to talk about
leveraging marketing data

77
00:03:04.180 --> 00:03:05.480
and you'll be better equipped

78
00:03:05.480 --> 00:03:09.410
to suggest artificial intelligence
uses in your own company.

79
00:03:09.410 --> 00:03:12.120
Identify when machine
learning might be overkill

80
00:03:12.120 --> 00:03:15.573
and navigate the conversation
with the data science team.
