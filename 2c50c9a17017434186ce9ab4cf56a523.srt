00:00:00.500 --> 00:00:02.140
- You've probably been in that meeting

2
00:00:02.140 --> 00:00:03.917
where some senior executive says,

3
00:00:03.917 --> 00:00:06.190
"Let use machine learning!"

4
00:00:06.190 --> 00:00:08.960
like it's the most
brilliant idea of the year.

5
00:00:08.960 --> 00:00:12.010
And you use all of your
self-control not to roll your eyes

6
00:00:12.010 --> 00:00:15.770
and mutter, "Management
by in-flight magazine."

7
00:00:15.770 --> 00:00:18.790
Machine learning may be the
most powerful software ever,

8
00:00:18.790 --> 00:00:20.220
but it's not magic.

9
00:00:20.220 --> 00:00:22.390
It's not good at solving all problems.

10
00:00:22.390 --> 00:00:24.710
So what do you say?

11
00:00:24.710 --> 00:00:26.870
Today, I'm going to help you figure out

12
00:00:26.870 --> 00:00:28.730
when machine learning is overkill

13
00:00:28.730 --> 00:00:31.600
and when it is the right tool for the job.

14
00:00:31.600 --> 00:00:33.750
Remember that machine learning

15
00:00:33.750 --> 00:00:36.130
is really good at correlation.

16
00:00:36.130 --> 00:00:38.670
People with this trait
usually have that trait.

17
00:00:38.670 --> 00:00:40.780
People with kids buy more cereal.

18
00:00:40.780 --> 00:00:45.000
Segmentation, these people
are more alike than others.

19
00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:47.970
They like to log on early in the day.

20
00:00:47.970 --> 00:00:51.300
Clustering, there are 10
distinct groups of people,

21
00:00:51.300 --> 00:00:52.960
and you can message them differently.

22
00:00:52.960 --> 00:00:56.250
And anomalies, these people are standouts.

23
00:00:56.250 --> 00:00:58.140
They don't look like anybody else.

24
00:00:58.140 --> 00:00:59.810
There may be something
wrong with the data,

25
00:00:59.810 --> 00:01:03.610
or there might be a business
opportunity hidden inside.

26
00:01:03.610 --> 00:01:07.290
In other words, machine
learning is good for ranking,

27
00:01:07.290 --> 00:01:10.900
sorting, finding patterns,
finding lookalikes,

28
00:01:10.900 --> 00:01:13.930
and finding that needle in a haystack.

29
00:01:13.930 --> 00:01:16.720
So you're looking for
repetitive high-volume tasks

30
00:01:16.720 --> 00:01:18.710
with lots and lots of clean data,

31
00:01:18.710 --> 00:01:21.050
like social media monitoring.

32
00:01:21.050 --> 00:01:23.520
Which of these tweets should
get a canned response?

33
00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:25.150
Which should get reviewed by a human?

34
00:01:25.150 --> 00:01:26.760
Which should we just ignore?

35
00:01:26.760 --> 00:01:30.140
Or advertising or testing
or personalization,

36
00:01:30.140 --> 00:01:32.120
lead scoring, things like that.

37
00:01:32.120 --> 00:01:35.210
The most important step is figuring out

38
00:01:35.210 --> 00:01:38.470
if any other method can solve the problem

39
00:01:38.470 --> 00:01:40.100
or answer the question.

40
00:01:40.100 --> 00:01:41.650
You don't want to fire up an 18-wheeler

41
00:01:41.650 --> 00:01:43.370
to run down to the corner store.

42
00:01:43.370 --> 00:01:45.980
You don't need a cannon to swat a fly.

43
00:01:45.980 --> 00:01:47.530
Machine learning might
be the coolest thing

44
00:01:47.530 --> 00:01:49.040
to hit the management department,

45
00:01:49.040 --> 00:01:51.410
but it costs a lot more
than using a spreadsheet

46
00:01:51.410 --> 00:01:54.060
or building a statistical model by hand.

47
00:01:54.060 --> 00:01:55.860
Let these key questions be your guide

48
00:01:55.860 --> 00:01:59.610
when considering machine
learning for a given project.

49
00:01:59.610 --> 00:02:03.030
Do you have tens of thousands
or millions of examples?

50
00:02:03.030 --> 00:02:06.920
That would be customers or
transactions or ad placements.

51
00:02:06.920 --> 00:02:08.580
Do you have an overwhelming number

52
00:02:08.580 --> 00:02:11.170
of combinations of elements?

53
00:02:11.170 --> 00:02:14.330
Maybe you have a thousand
variables or traits

54
00:02:14.330 --> 00:02:17.530
about each customer to
sift through and correlate.

55
00:02:17.530 --> 00:02:19.350
Is your data squeaky clean?

56
00:02:19.350 --> 00:02:21.330
If not, the cost just went way up

57
00:02:21.330 --> 00:02:23.940
because you have to clean it first.

58
00:02:23.940 --> 00:02:25.870
Is your data well-labeled?

59
00:02:25.870 --> 00:02:29.710
Context is everything.
Otherwise, it's just noise.

60
00:02:29.710 --> 00:02:32.200
Are you sure simpler methods won't work?

61
00:02:32.200 --> 00:02:33.580
Try Excel first.

62
00:02:33.580 --> 00:02:35.890
Heck, sometimes you could just flip a coin

63
00:02:35.890 --> 00:02:38.210
to make some decisions.

64
00:02:38.210 --> 00:02:40.250
Do you have clear goals?

65
00:02:40.250 --> 00:02:42.970
You need an unmistakable definition

66
00:02:42.970 --> 00:02:45.470
of what success looks like.

67
00:02:45.470 --> 00:02:48.510
What will you do with the answer?

68
00:02:48.510 --> 00:02:50.640
If you could simply Google the answer,

69
00:02:50.640 --> 00:02:52.600
would it have an impact on the business?

70
00:02:52.600 --> 00:02:54.560
Yes? Good.

71
00:02:54.560 --> 00:02:56.450
But what if it cost $50,000

72
00:02:56.450 --> 00:02:58.630
and took six weeks to answer the question?

73
00:02:58.630 --> 00:03:00.940
Is it still worth it?

74
00:03:00.940 --> 00:03:03.480
You bring these questions to the table

75
00:03:03.480 --> 00:03:06.500
next time somebody asks if
they can use machine learning,

76
00:03:06.500 --> 00:03:07.900
and you will instantly be seen

77
00:03:07.900 --> 00:03:10.250
as the most well-informed
marketing professional

78
00:03:10.250 --> 00:03:12.810
on the planet because this list,

79
00:03:12.810 --> 00:03:16.190
it hasn't hit the in-flight magazines yet.

80
00:03:16.190 --> 00:03:19.293
And this exercise sheet
can help you every time.
