00:00:00.400 --> 00:00:03.400
- A toddler can tell the
difference between a cat and a dog

2
00:00:03.400 --> 00:00:05.570
with only a few examples.

3
00:00:05.570 --> 00:00:08.770
Now what if that child
could find and count

4
00:00:08.770 --> 00:00:10.610
all the people on social media

5
00:00:10.610 --> 00:00:12.390
who are wearing your sunglasses

6
00:00:12.390 --> 00:00:14.030
or holding your energy drink

7
00:00:14.030 --> 00:00:16.380
or had your car in the background?

8
00:00:16.380 --> 00:00:18.600
See how that might be
useful for marketing.

9
00:00:18.600 --> 00:00:23.020
Artificial intelligence and
cameras give us computer vision.

10
00:00:23.020 --> 00:00:26.370
A whole new way of interacting
with prospects and customers,

11
00:00:26.370 --> 00:00:28.260
and understanding this technology,

12
00:00:28.260 --> 00:00:30.680
its limitations and possibilities,

13
00:00:30.680 --> 00:00:33.440
will give you a leg up on the competition.

14
00:00:33.440 --> 00:00:36.560
Like most AI, computer
vision isn't perfect.

15
00:00:36.560 --> 00:00:38.450
It's great at recognizing things,

16
00:00:38.450 --> 00:00:40.050
but don't for a minute think,

17
00:00:40.050 --> 00:00:42.820
that it understands what it sees.

18
00:00:42.820 --> 00:00:44.920
Can it tell a cat from a dog?

19
00:00:44.920 --> 00:00:46.400
Most of the time.

20
00:00:46.400 --> 00:00:48.240
But small things can throw it off

21
00:00:48.240 --> 00:00:51.390
because the computer is not
making sense of the world,

22
00:00:51.390 --> 00:00:52.870
it's looking at pixels

23
00:00:52.870 --> 00:00:55.610
and deciding that these
shapes and these shades

24
00:00:55.610 --> 00:00:58.530
have a higher probability of being a cat.

25
00:00:58.530 --> 00:01:00.480
If the cat is looking the wrong way,

26
00:01:00.480 --> 00:01:03.440
has its ears down, is curled up asleep,

27
00:01:03.440 --> 00:01:05.610
the computer's confused.

28
00:01:05.610 --> 00:01:07.060
That's the catch.

29
00:01:07.060 --> 00:01:10.000
You have to show the computer
tens of thousands of pictures

30
00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:14.170
that you have labeled cats
before it can do its thing.

31
00:01:14.170 --> 00:01:17.420
This is called supervised learning.

32
00:01:17.420 --> 00:01:21.080
You know those Captcha prove
you're not a robot logins,

33
00:01:21.080 --> 00:01:24.800
that's you labeling the
data for computer vision.

34
00:01:24.800 --> 00:01:26.090
You are teaching the computer

35
00:01:26.090 --> 00:01:27.840
how to recognize the street sign,

36
00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:29.970
the crosswalk, the traffic light.

37
00:01:29.970 --> 00:01:32.810
Don't you think self-driving
cars would want to know?

38
00:01:32.810 --> 00:01:35.720
The technology can get
pretty sophisticated,

39
00:01:35.720 --> 00:01:39.980
even giving us facial recognition
and augmented reality.

40
00:01:39.980 --> 00:01:42.610
The computer can recognize
that your face is a face

41
00:01:42.610 --> 00:01:44.860
and that it's your face.

42
00:01:44.860 --> 00:01:47.400
You can unlock your phone
just by looking at it.

43
00:01:47.400 --> 00:01:50.600
The computer can also identify
the features of your face

44
00:01:50.600 --> 00:01:53.690
and the result is all those
silly Snapchat filters.

45
00:01:53.690 --> 00:01:55.650
You've probably played
with Zoom backgrounds.

46
00:01:55.650 --> 00:01:57.880
Yup, computer vision.

47
00:01:57.880 --> 00:02:00.480
So what are the
possibilities for marketing?

48
00:02:00.480 --> 00:02:02.740
Depending on your product or service,

49
00:02:02.740 --> 00:02:05.910
computer vision can open up
new avenues for connecting you

50
00:02:05.910 --> 00:02:07.720
with your customers and prospects.

51
00:02:07.720 --> 00:02:10.450
You might let people
view your virtual product

52
00:02:10.450 --> 00:02:12.230
in their actual home.

53
00:02:12.230 --> 00:02:15.000
Maybe you let people try
on virtual hairstyles

54
00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:17.880
or lipstick colors or
1,000 different outfits,

55
00:02:17.880 --> 00:02:20.480
or overlay additional
information on your products

56
00:02:20.480 --> 00:02:21.940
when people view them through

57
00:02:21.940 --> 00:02:25.320
their phones' camera augmented reality,

58
00:02:25.320 --> 00:02:27.860
or you could automatically
recognize your loyal customers

59
00:02:27.860 --> 00:02:30.400
when they walk in the
door, facial recognition.

60
00:02:30.400 --> 00:02:32.490
What used to just be science fiction

61
00:02:32.490 --> 00:02:35.630
is now a tool for the
marketing department.

62
00:02:35.630 --> 00:02:37.630
How do you interact with your customers?

63
00:02:37.630 --> 00:02:39.100
Brainstorm with your team.

64
00:02:39.100 --> 00:02:42.440
Come up with all the ways
computer vision might be useful

65
00:02:42.440 --> 00:02:44.730
and figure out which
ones are worth testing.

66
00:02:44.730 --> 00:02:48.610
Then when some Chief something
or other officer asks

67
00:02:48.610 --> 00:02:51.310
if the marketing department is using AI,

68
00:02:51.310 --> 00:02:53.573
you can assure them that
you're on top of it.
