00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.840
- What do you say

2
00:00:00.840 --> 00:00:03.507
when a toddler reaches for
something on the ground?

3
00:00:03.507 --> 00:00:06.380
"Don't touch that, you
never know where it's been."

4
00:00:06.380 --> 00:00:08.690
That's how you should
feel about your data.

5
00:00:08.690 --> 00:00:11.630
Even in the most straightforward
charts and graphs,

6
00:00:11.630 --> 00:00:14.130
if you don't know where
your data came from,

7
00:00:14.130 --> 00:00:17.340
how it was harvested,
how it was processed,

8
00:00:17.340 --> 00:00:19.080
you don't want to make
important business decisions

9
00:00:19.080 --> 00:00:20.900
based on that.

10
00:00:20.900 --> 00:00:22.020
Garbage in, garbage out

11
00:00:22.020 --> 00:00:23.770
has always been the case with computers,

12
00:00:23.770 --> 00:00:26.850
but now we're using machine
learning to analyze data.

13
00:00:26.850 --> 00:00:28.000
It's even more important

14
00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:31.190
that you know the lineage of your data.

15
00:00:31.190 --> 00:00:34.970
How do you keep from getting
blindsided by bad data?

16
00:00:34.970 --> 00:00:37.590
By taking responsibility for it.

17
00:00:37.590 --> 00:00:39.550
Imagine you run a soup factory.

18
00:00:39.550 --> 00:00:42.180
20 to 30 ingredients come
in through the shipping dock

19
00:00:42.180 --> 00:00:45.730
and thousands of cans of
chicken soup go out the back.

20
00:00:45.730 --> 00:00:48.580
Now, if your soup makes people sick,

21
00:00:48.580 --> 00:00:51.800
you have to figure out which
ingredient caused the problem.

22
00:00:51.800 --> 00:00:55.110
Was it the water, the salt,
the chicken, the veggies?

23
00:00:55.110 --> 00:00:58.230
Each one of those is handled
in such a different way

24
00:00:58.230 --> 00:01:00.630
that you need people
with special knowledge

25
00:01:00.630 --> 00:01:02.480
to manage the acquisition, handling,

26
00:01:02.480 --> 00:01:04.560
and cooking of each one.

27
00:01:04.560 --> 00:01:06.510
Same thing with data.

28
00:01:06.510 --> 00:01:09.180
Data is collected, formatted, cleaned,

29
00:01:09.180 --> 00:01:11.650
moved into a database
where it can be reformatted

30
00:01:11.650 --> 00:01:13.200
so it can be combined with other data

31
00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:15.700
and then poured into a
huge data storage bin

32
00:01:15.700 --> 00:01:19.170
where the machine learning
algorithm can access it.

33
00:01:19.170 --> 00:01:23.410
That's a lot of steps where
a lot of things can go wrong.

34
00:01:23.410 --> 00:01:25.420
You won't know there's a problem

35
00:01:25.420 --> 00:01:28.080
until your soup starts making people sick.

36
00:01:28.080 --> 00:01:32.740
You won't know the data is
corrupted until it's too late.

37
00:01:32.740 --> 00:01:36.060
For instance, did the computer
recommend sending coupons

38
00:01:36.060 --> 00:01:39.800
for contact lenses to people
who read braille books?

39
00:01:39.800 --> 00:01:43.390
Did the algorithm advise
promoting your elder care products

40
00:01:43.390 --> 00:01:45.470
to college students?

41
00:01:45.470 --> 00:01:47.460
Did the model predict
that sales of ice cream

42
00:01:47.460 --> 00:01:49.950
will triple in the winter?

43
00:01:49.950 --> 00:01:53.440
You'll need a data steward
for each data stream.

44
00:01:53.440 --> 00:01:55.150
So you have somebody with knowledge

45
00:01:55.150 --> 00:01:56.640
to track down why the output

46
00:01:56.640 --> 00:01:59.510
from the algorithm doesn't
pass the smell test.

47
00:01:59.510 --> 00:02:01.150
We have so much data now.

48
00:02:01.150 --> 00:02:03.080
So many different kinds of data

49
00:02:03.080 --> 00:02:05.260
that you need to start with an inventory

50
00:02:05.260 --> 00:02:08.280
of what data you have
about your customers.

51
00:02:08.280 --> 00:02:11.230
And what you can find
out about your prospects.

52
00:02:11.230 --> 00:02:14.770
You have, or can get
information about who they are,

53
00:02:14.770 --> 00:02:16.610
their identity, what they've done,

54
00:02:16.610 --> 00:02:19.950
their history, what they
like, their preferences,

55
00:02:19.950 --> 00:02:22.170
what they own, their possessions,

56
00:02:22.170 --> 00:02:23.610
what they do, their activities

57
00:02:23.610 --> 00:02:26.550
and how they feel,
their moods and beliefs.

58
00:02:26.550 --> 00:02:28.270
All of that is available.

59
00:02:28.270 --> 00:02:29.770
When you put all that together,

60
00:02:29.770 --> 00:02:32.990
you can generate some
supremely powerful insights,

61
00:02:32.990 --> 00:02:34.410
but if you don't have a data steward

62
00:02:34.410 --> 00:02:39.150
to monitor each data stream,
you are flying blind.

63
00:02:39.150 --> 00:02:40.840
You need to be able to trust your data

64
00:02:40.840 --> 00:02:42.380
to the point where you'd be willing

65
00:02:42.380 --> 00:02:44.570
to make serious business decisions,

66
00:02:44.570 --> 00:02:48.560
stake your reputation, and
bet your job on the output.

67
00:02:48.560 --> 00:02:51.710
The very first step is
to make that inventory

68
00:02:51.710 --> 00:02:56.200
of what data you rely on to
run your part of the business.

69
00:02:56.200 --> 00:02:59.050
Next, go make friends
with every individual

70
00:02:59.050 --> 00:03:02.470
who collects and manages
each one of those datasets.

71
00:03:02.470 --> 00:03:05.030
Buy them lunch, ask them
about their process.

72
00:03:05.030 --> 00:03:08.760
Find out how confident they
are in the technology they use.

73
00:03:08.760 --> 00:03:12.230
You are now on the path to data literacy.

74
00:03:12.230 --> 00:03:15.040
Soon you'll be able to see the big picture

75
00:03:15.040 --> 00:03:17.200
and you'll know whom to turn to

76
00:03:17.200 --> 00:03:19.680
when bad data causes the algorithm

77
00:03:19.680 --> 00:03:22.070
to recommend that you
sell all of your products

78
00:03:22.070 --> 00:03:25.023
for 3 cents with free shipping.
