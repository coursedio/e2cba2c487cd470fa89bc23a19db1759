00:00:00.220 --> 00:00:01.720
- If you're trying to bring the power

2
00:00:01.720 --> 00:00:05.210
of artificial intelligence
into your business today,

3
00:00:05.210 --> 00:00:07.270
you may have to overcome the naysayers

4
00:00:07.270 --> 00:00:10.720
who don't believe AI is
ready for prime time yet.

5
00:00:10.720 --> 00:00:13.850
To convince the doubters,
you only need to explain

6
00:00:13.850 --> 00:00:16.460
a few of the building
blocks that came together

7
00:00:16.460 --> 00:00:18.970
to make AI a reality.

8
00:00:18.970 --> 00:00:21.800
Artificial intelligence
was dreamed up decades ago.

9
00:00:21.800 --> 00:00:24.360
It flourished for a while in the 1960s,

10
00:00:24.360 --> 00:00:27.950
and then disappeared in
disfavor until the late '90s.

11
00:00:27.950 --> 00:00:30.970
But we go back to 1950 when Alan Turing

12
00:00:30.970 --> 00:00:32.357
published a paper called,

13
00:00:32.357 --> 00:00:37.400
"Computing Machinery and
Intelligence" which was all theory.

14
00:00:37.400 --> 00:00:39.340
If computers could run fast enough

15
00:00:39.340 --> 00:00:40.950
and if there was enough data,

16
00:00:40.950 --> 00:00:43.650
then maybe the math could work like this.

17
00:00:43.650 --> 00:00:46.900
The term artificial
intelligence was coined in 1956

18
00:00:46.900 --> 00:00:49.640
at a conference at Dartmouth College.

19
00:00:49.640 --> 00:00:52.200
Between then and the mid-70s,

20
00:00:52.200 --> 00:00:55.450
venture capital was thrown
at AI where we discovered

21
00:00:55.450 --> 00:00:58.330
that it is much harder than we thought.

22
00:00:58.330 --> 00:01:01.830
But four things came together
around the turn of the century

23
00:01:01.830 --> 00:01:03.520
that made AI possible.

24
00:01:03.520 --> 00:01:06.610
First, Google and Yahoo figured
out how to link together

25
00:01:06.610 --> 00:01:11.950
huge numbers of computers,
central processing units, CPUs,

26
00:01:11.950 --> 00:01:14.750
giving us massive computing power.

27
00:01:14.750 --> 00:01:17.520
And the gaming industry
played a big part here

28
00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:21.070
because they had manufactured
graphical processing units,

29
00:01:21.070 --> 00:01:25.050
GPUs, which were much
faster and just the ticket

30
00:01:25.050 --> 00:01:28.110
for the kind of calculations AI needs.

31
00:01:28.110 --> 00:01:31.660
Next was the explosive
growth of the amount of data

32
00:01:31.660 --> 00:01:33.550
that we have at our fingertips,

33
00:01:33.550 --> 00:01:36.900
megabytes and gigabytes
just wasn't enough.

34
00:01:36.900 --> 00:01:39.260
We would need terabytes
and petabytes of data

35
00:01:39.260 --> 00:01:42.330
for AI to chew one, and now we have it

36
00:01:42.330 --> 00:01:43.680
thanks to the internet.

37
00:01:43.680 --> 00:01:45.970
And the internet also gave
us a giant leap forward

38
00:01:45.970 --> 00:01:49.650
in online data storage, the cloud.

39
00:01:49.650 --> 00:01:52.310
Not only did we have a huge
amount of data to play with,

40
00:01:52.310 --> 00:01:54.800
there was finally a place to store it all.

41
00:01:54.800 --> 00:01:55.960
The last piece of the puzzle

42
00:01:55.960 --> 00:01:58.310
was the whole open source movement.

43
00:01:58.310 --> 00:02:00.480
When software is published openly,

44
00:02:00.480 --> 00:02:04.530
everybody can make improvements,
speeding the process.

45
00:02:04.530 --> 00:02:07.030
Because of open-source philosophy,

46
00:02:07.030 --> 00:02:09.940
the majority of research into
AI has been freely published

47
00:02:09.940 --> 00:02:12.500
for anybody to read and to use.

48
00:02:12.500 --> 00:02:16.140
Google, Microsoft, IBM,
Amazon have all made AI tools

49
00:02:16.140 --> 00:02:18.940
and access to data all but free

50
00:02:18.940 --> 00:02:20.280
in order to encourage the world

51
00:02:20.280 --> 00:02:23.000
to push this technology forward.

52
00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:26.859
Put all these together and
we can now run AI programs

53
00:02:26.859 --> 00:02:29.400
on your phone and your wristwatch.

54
00:02:29.400 --> 00:02:31.780
So next time somebody
tries to block your idea

55
00:02:31.780 --> 00:02:34.610
about putting AI to
use in your department,

56
00:02:34.610 --> 00:02:38.020
you can confidently tell
them that the time has come,

57
00:02:38.020 --> 00:02:40.453
now is the time to get started.
