00:00:00.330 --> 00:00:02.040
- What if you had a fresh intern

2
00:00:02.040 --> 00:00:03.700
who could remember everything you said

3
00:00:03.700 --> 00:00:05.710
and really understand your customer,

4
00:00:05.710 --> 00:00:08.920
who they are, what they like,
their purchase behavior.

5
00:00:08.920 --> 00:00:10.610
What if they intuitively grasp

6
00:00:10.610 --> 00:00:13.670
the value of a good lead
and who you should target,

7
00:00:13.670 --> 00:00:15.670
all at the speed of light?

8
00:00:15.670 --> 00:00:18.100
You just provide them
with a little guidance

9
00:00:18.100 --> 00:00:19.890
and let them run with it.

10
00:00:19.890 --> 00:00:22.180
Well, that would be an ideal employee.

11
00:00:22.180 --> 00:00:25.300
And that employee is
real and available today

12
00:00:25.300 --> 00:00:28.450
in something called supervised learning.

13
00:00:28.450 --> 00:00:30.030
It's an engine that's powering

14
00:00:30.030 --> 00:00:32.020
the frontier of marketing.

15
00:00:32.020 --> 00:00:34.560
In this video, I want
to help you understand

16
00:00:34.560 --> 00:00:36.410
what supervised learning is.

17
00:00:36.410 --> 00:00:37.970
So you can make real decisions

18
00:00:37.970 --> 00:00:40.290
about how you can use this technology

19
00:00:40.290 --> 00:00:42.730
to help you improve your marketing.

20
00:00:42.730 --> 00:00:44.320
You'll know where it makes sense

21
00:00:44.320 --> 00:00:46.290
and how it can really help.

22
00:00:46.290 --> 00:00:49.080
Supervised learning is
where you teach the machine

23
00:00:49.080 --> 00:00:51.900
through example and correction.

24
00:00:51.900 --> 00:00:54.350
You can't really explain
how you know a cat is a cat,

25
00:00:54.350 --> 00:00:56.290
but you know one when you see one.

26
00:00:56.290 --> 00:00:58.260
Writing a bunch of software rules

27
00:00:58.260 --> 00:01:01.150
to define a cat is beyond difficult.

28
00:01:01.150 --> 00:01:04.240
But if you give the machine
a million pictures of cats,

29
00:01:04.240 --> 00:01:07.550
it can determine how to
recognize a cat on its own,

30
00:01:07.550 --> 00:01:10.030
especially as you correct
it when it's wrong,

31
00:01:10.030 --> 00:01:11.770
that's the supervision part.

32
00:01:11.770 --> 00:01:14.870
Give the machine everything
you know about your customers,

33
00:01:14.870 --> 00:01:17.110
tell it which ones are
your best customers,

34
00:01:17.110 --> 00:01:20.980
and it can figure out what
the best have in common.

35
00:01:20.980 --> 00:01:24.910
You don't need to outline
a persona or a profile.

36
00:01:24.910 --> 00:01:27.450
The machine learns from the data.

37
00:01:27.450 --> 00:01:29.240
Then you can ask the machine

38
00:01:29.240 --> 00:01:32.060
to find non-customers out in the world

39
00:01:32.060 --> 00:01:34.020
that might fit the general profile

40
00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:35.970
of your best customers.

41
00:01:35.970 --> 00:01:39.710
Your list of current customers
is the training data.

42
00:01:39.710 --> 00:01:41.150
The machine looks at your list,

43
00:01:41.150 --> 00:01:43.400
figures out what they have in common,

44
00:01:43.400 --> 00:01:44.930
and decides which elements

45
00:01:44.930 --> 00:01:48.540
are the most predictive of goodness.

46
00:01:48.540 --> 00:01:50.330
Using these criteria,

47
00:01:50.330 --> 00:01:52.360
it looks at prospective customers

48
00:01:52.360 --> 00:01:55.720
and shows you the ones
you should be targeting.

49
00:01:55.720 --> 00:01:56.847
You then get the chance to say,

50
00:01:56.847 --> 00:01:59.310
"Yes, these are the cats I'm looking for,"

51
00:01:59.310 --> 00:02:00.957
or correct the machine by saying,

52
00:02:00.957 --> 00:02:04.300
"These are dogs," or
"This is not a prospect,

53
00:02:04.300 --> 00:02:07.280
this is a competitor,"
or "This is a student,"

54
00:02:07.280 --> 00:02:10.000
and it won't make the same mistake again.

55
00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:12.410
Now a word of warning.

56
00:02:12.410 --> 00:02:15.820
The machine might decide
that all your best customers

57
00:02:15.820 --> 00:02:17.330
are named Daniel, so it brings you

58
00:02:17.330 --> 00:02:19.390
all the Daniels it can find.

59
00:02:19.390 --> 00:02:21.870
While that might be statistically true,

60
00:02:21.870 --> 00:02:23.900
it's not useful.

61
00:02:23.900 --> 00:02:25.610
Carry on a conversation with the machine

62
00:02:25.610 --> 00:02:28.360
until it starts coming up
with good enough answers

63
00:02:28.360 --> 00:02:32.740
then better answers, and then
results that are far superior,

64
00:02:32.740 --> 00:02:35.840
and in much less time than humans can.

65
00:02:35.840 --> 00:02:37.690
The machine learns by example,

66
00:02:37.690 --> 00:02:40.250
and by you guiding it,
and rejecting the answers

67
00:02:40.250 --> 00:02:43.120
that might be true, but aren't helpful.

68
00:02:43.120 --> 00:02:46.250
Now in order to uncover
how machine learning

69
00:02:46.250 --> 00:02:49.370
can make the most
difference in your company,

70
00:02:49.370 --> 00:02:51.210
I want you to make a prioritized list

71
00:02:51.210 --> 00:02:53.000
of which tasks would be best

72
00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:56.340
for supervised learning at the moment.

73
00:02:56.340 --> 00:02:57.857
Your ideas could sound like,

74
00:02:57.857 --> 00:03:00.567
"Did our logo show up
today's social media feed?"

75
00:03:00.567 --> 00:03:02.457
"Did our competitor's logo show up?"

76
00:03:02.457 --> 00:03:05.917
"What do our best blog
posts have in common?"

77
00:03:05.917 --> 00:03:08.780
"Where should we open
our next retail store?"

78
00:03:08.780 --> 00:03:11.450
Now, you list some ideas on your own.

79
00:03:11.450 --> 00:03:12.820
Because at the end of the day,

80
00:03:12.820 --> 00:03:16.290
supervised learning boosts
your cognitive skills,

81
00:03:16.290 --> 00:03:18.750
helps you apply your knowledge at scale,

82
00:03:18.750 --> 00:03:21.800
and lets you produce significant results

83
00:03:21.800 --> 00:03:23.853
to transform your marketing.
