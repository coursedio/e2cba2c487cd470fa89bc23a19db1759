00:00:00.260 --> 00:00:01.870
- Years ago, I worked for a company

2
00:00:01.870 --> 00:00:05.270
whose management made
such weird decisions that

3
00:00:05.270 --> 00:00:06.560
about once a week, somebody

4
00:00:06.560 --> 00:00:09.090
on the staff would turn
to the next person,

5
00:00:09.090 --> 00:00:13.950
roll their eyes and say, "Logic
that defies imagination."

6
00:00:13.950 --> 00:00:16.480
It was a frustrating place to work.

7
00:00:16.480 --> 00:00:20.010
Every organization has its
own style, manner, culture,

8
00:00:20.010 --> 00:00:22.940
political traps, but you can survive

9
00:00:22.940 --> 00:00:25.620
and even thrive in bringing
artificial intelligence

10
00:00:25.620 --> 00:00:27.050
into your marketing efforts.

11
00:00:27.050 --> 00:00:30.890
In any environment with
a few key insights.

12
00:00:30.890 --> 00:00:33.350
Start by assessing where your company sits

13
00:00:33.350 --> 00:00:36.570
on the marketing data literacy spectrum.

14
00:00:36.570 --> 00:00:41.260
At one end and are the data
deniers to our old school

15
00:00:41.260 --> 00:00:45.600
mad men types with giant egos
who know that they're smarter

16
00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:47.670
than any data nerd.

17
00:00:47.670 --> 00:00:48.680
If your organization is

18
00:00:48.680 --> 00:00:51.690
at this end of the spectrum, just get out.

19
00:00:51.690 --> 00:00:53.380
Really find another place to work

20
00:00:53.380 --> 00:00:55.260
if you're interested in machine learning.

21
00:00:55.260 --> 00:00:57.330
But what if the firm is data aware,

22
00:00:57.330 --> 00:00:59.610
but not yet data literate?

23
00:00:59.610 --> 00:01:01.290
Then they will likely be receptive

24
00:01:01.290 --> 00:01:04.400
to lunch and learns
carefully crafted webinars

25
00:01:04.400 --> 00:01:07.100
case studies of how other
companies have done well.

26
00:01:07.100 --> 00:01:10.060
Especially if those case studies
are about your competitors.

27
00:01:10.060 --> 00:01:11.240
If your firm falls more

28
00:01:11.240 --> 00:01:14.370
toward the data capable or
data savvy end of the spectrum

29
00:01:14.370 --> 00:01:17.010
lucky you, that means
they are already using

30
00:01:17.010 --> 00:01:21.120
or at least thinking about
using AI in a variety of ways.

31
00:01:21.120 --> 00:01:24.770
And you can show them how
useful it can be in marketing.

32
00:01:24.770 --> 00:01:27.190
Data savvy or just data aware.

33
00:01:27.190 --> 00:01:31.590
If nobody has gotten involved
with AI yet, who has time

34
00:01:31.590 --> 00:01:35.610
then it's up to you to bring
them to the table slowly.

35
00:01:35.610 --> 00:01:38.290
Now's your opportunity
to boost their knowledge

36
00:01:38.290 --> 00:01:41.070
of analytics and statistics.

37
00:01:41.070 --> 00:01:42.770
Explain the whole thing is the difference

38
00:01:42.770 --> 00:01:45.360
between accounting and probability.

39
00:01:45.360 --> 00:01:48.690
Accounting is about facts
expressed with certainty.

40
00:01:48.690 --> 00:01:50.870
Statistics is about likelihood

41
00:01:50.870 --> 00:01:53.950
expressed as degrees of confidence.

42
00:01:53.950 --> 00:01:56.460
How many umbrellas do we
have is much different

43
00:01:56.460 --> 00:01:59.330
than what are the chances
it's going to rain?

44
00:01:59.330 --> 00:02:01.560
When you find those
people who seem to get it

45
00:02:01.560 --> 00:02:05.140
and are interested, it's
time to start some meetups,

46
00:02:05.140 --> 00:02:06.840
casual lunchtime conversations

47
00:02:06.840 --> 00:02:09.840
about the possibilities of using AI.

48
00:02:09.840 --> 00:02:13.300
Form an informal study
group and feed them lunch.

49
00:02:13.300 --> 00:02:14.810
See who has the curiosity

50
00:02:14.810 --> 00:02:18.050
and the time to run some experiments.

51
00:02:18.050 --> 00:02:20.020
This is definitely a skunk works

52
00:02:20.020 --> 00:02:23.500
seeking forgiveness rather
than permission kind of thing.

53
00:02:23.500 --> 00:02:26.367
Just go do it and learn as you do.

54
00:02:26.367 --> 00:02:29.740
This off the record task force
can start collecting stories

55
00:02:29.740 --> 00:02:32.370
and best practices to share with others.

56
00:02:32.370 --> 00:02:34.130
Then it'll be time to search

57
00:02:34.130 --> 00:02:36.230
for a sponsor, some executive level

58
00:02:36.230 --> 00:02:38.320
enthusiast who will support your efforts

59
00:02:38.320 --> 00:02:39.870
throw some budget your way

60
00:02:39.870 --> 00:02:41.810
and help you make progress.

61
00:02:41.810 --> 00:02:44.120
All the while, tell everybody

62
00:02:44.120 --> 00:02:48.080
that your goal is to build
an AI center of excellence.

63
00:02:48.080 --> 00:02:49.933
Everybody wants one of those.
