00:00:00.670 --> 00:00:02.610
- How would you like to be an AI-powered

2
00:00:02.610 --> 00:00:03.960
marketing professional?

3
00:00:03.960 --> 00:00:07.030
No, I'm not talking about
turning you into a cyborg.

4
00:00:07.030 --> 00:00:09.200
I'm talking about giving you the skills

5
00:00:09.200 --> 00:00:11.980
to harness the power of
artificial intelligence

6
00:00:11.980 --> 00:00:14.580
for yourself, personally,

7
00:00:14.580 --> 00:00:17.570
so you can be the one to lead the pack.

8
00:00:17.570 --> 00:00:19.830
You'll have a huge advantage
over others in your company

9
00:00:19.830 --> 00:00:22.820
or in the pool of candidates
vying for that new job.

10
00:00:22.820 --> 00:00:26.750
The first step to becoming
an AI-savvy marketer

11
00:00:26.750 --> 00:00:29.110
is blindingly straightforward.

12
00:00:29.110 --> 00:00:33.600
Learn about the SQL data
management programming language.

13
00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:35.930
I don't mean that you
need to learn to code SQL

14
00:00:35.930 --> 00:00:37.920
or become a programmer.

15
00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:39.550
I mean that you need to understand

16
00:00:39.550 --> 00:00:41.470
what it is and how it works.

17
00:00:41.470 --> 00:00:44.250
Even just spending an hour
reading the Wikipedia article

18
00:00:44.250 --> 00:00:47.970
about SQL will give you a serious boost.

19
00:00:47.970 --> 00:00:48.803
Next,

20
00:00:48.803 --> 00:00:51.120
learn the most popular
marketing automation tools

21
00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:53.080
and their AI components.

22
00:00:53.080 --> 00:00:55.700
IBM has Watson Marketing Insights,

23
00:00:55.700 --> 00:00:57.390
Salesforce has Einstein,

24
00:00:57.390 --> 00:00:59.340
Adobe has Sensei.

25
00:00:59.340 --> 00:01:03.360
These are AI tools built
into each marketing platform.

26
00:01:03.360 --> 00:01:04.960
You don't need to learn them all,

27
00:01:04.960 --> 00:01:07.100
but you should learn one of them.

28
00:01:07.100 --> 00:01:08.630
The one your company uses,

29
00:01:08.630 --> 00:01:11.450
or the one that you can get
your hands on the easiest.

30
00:01:11.450 --> 00:01:13.900
That'll help you learn any of the others

31
00:01:13.900 --> 00:01:15.710
when you come across them.

32
00:01:15.710 --> 00:01:16.840
It's like driving,

33
00:01:16.840 --> 00:01:18.750
when you apply to be a delivery person.

34
00:01:18.750 --> 00:01:20.640
They want to know if you can drive.

35
00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:22.670
Whether you learned in a Ford F-150

36
00:01:22.670 --> 00:01:24.900
or a Chevy Silverado doesn't matter,

37
00:01:24.900 --> 00:01:27.180
so long as you know your
way around a pick-up.

38
00:01:27.180 --> 00:01:30.350
Finally, and this is the sweet spot.

39
00:01:30.350 --> 00:01:33.820
Augment yourself with AI tools.

40
00:01:33.820 --> 00:01:38.390
Train your own bots to
enhance the way you work.

41
00:01:38.390 --> 00:01:40.220
You use spell check, right?

42
00:01:40.220 --> 00:01:43.200
You've been adding unique
words to your dictionary.

43
00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:44.480
This isn't AI,

44
00:01:44.480 --> 00:01:46.490
but it is personalized spell check

45
00:01:46.490 --> 00:01:48.200
and it's a start.

46
00:01:48.200 --> 00:01:51.020
When you write formulas
in Excel spreadsheets,

47
00:01:51.020 --> 00:01:54.180
you are programming it
to think like you do.

48
00:01:54.180 --> 00:01:57.010
Maybe you've even written
some Excel macros.

49
00:01:57.010 --> 00:02:00.820
you are building a library
of cognitive shortcuts.

50
00:02:00.820 --> 00:02:01.653
Now,

51
00:02:01.653 --> 00:02:04.510
let's add some AI power to your toolkit.

52
00:02:04.510 --> 00:02:07.740
What about an AI meeting scheduler?

53
00:02:07.740 --> 00:02:11.460
There are tools that act
like a personal assistant

54
00:02:11.460 --> 00:02:12.510
to arrange a meeting.

55
00:02:12.510 --> 00:02:13.380
Doodle poll?

56
00:02:13.380 --> 00:02:15.230
Oh, that's so last decade.

57
00:02:15.230 --> 00:02:17.550
This AI version looks at your calendar,

58
00:02:17.550 --> 00:02:20.730
knows which day has a big
enough gap in meetings

59
00:02:20.730 --> 00:02:22.680
to make it to your favorite
restaurant and back.

60
00:02:22.680 --> 00:02:24.650
And then it negotiates over email

61
00:02:24.650 --> 00:02:26.150
with the people you're meeting

62
00:02:26.150 --> 00:02:27.390
to set the appointment,

63
00:02:27.390 --> 00:02:29.040
and it updates your calendar.

64
00:02:29.040 --> 00:02:31.020
There are now auto-complete systems

65
00:02:31.020 --> 00:02:32.090
that use machine learning

66
00:02:32.090 --> 00:02:35.310
to suggest ways to finish
sentences you start.

67
00:02:35.310 --> 00:02:38.620
Trainable to your writing style.

68
00:02:38.620 --> 00:02:40.620
You teach it how you write,

69
00:02:40.620 --> 00:02:42.750
and then you can write a lot faster.

70
00:02:42.750 --> 00:02:46.960
You train your bots to do
just about anything your way.

71
00:02:46.960 --> 00:02:49.360
Train them to book travel the way you like

72
00:02:49.360 --> 00:02:51.640
or manage your expense
reporting the way you want.

73
00:02:51.640 --> 00:02:55.990
Or review contracts for problems
you know, might be there.

74
00:02:55.990 --> 00:02:57.900
So here's what I want you to do.

75
00:02:57.900 --> 00:03:00.710
Make a list of all the
repetitive tasks that you do

76
00:03:00.710 --> 00:03:03.520
that you could train an intern to do.

77
00:03:03.520 --> 00:03:06.330
That new intern is AI.

78
00:03:06.330 --> 00:03:07.590
Do your research.

79
00:03:07.590 --> 00:03:10.070
Look around for which
AI systems specialize

80
00:03:10.070 --> 00:03:11.170
in what you're looking for.

81
00:03:11.170 --> 00:03:14.150
As they say, there's an app for that.

82
00:03:14.150 --> 00:03:16.870
Pick one or two to
familiarize yourself with,

83
00:03:16.870 --> 00:03:19.780
and start training your bots.

84
00:03:19.780 --> 00:03:23.530
When you've become a full-fledged
AI powered professional,

85
00:03:23.530 --> 00:03:27.530
list the team of AI agents
that you have adopted

86
00:03:27.530 --> 00:03:31.700
and trained on your resume
or LinkedIn profile.

87
00:03:31.700 --> 00:03:33.790
That shows you are a standout.

88
00:03:33.790 --> 00:03:36.803
And the best marketing
professional for the job.
