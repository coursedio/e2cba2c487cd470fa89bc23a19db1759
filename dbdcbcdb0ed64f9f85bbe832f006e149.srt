1
00:00:00.640 --> 00:00:01.810
- And there you have it.

2
00:00:01.810 --> 00:00:03.780
You have reached the end of the course.

3
00:00:03.780 --> 00:00:05.870
I want to thank you very
much for joining me.

4
00:00:05.870 --> 00:00:08.920
I am excited that you are
now well enough informed

5
00:00:08.920 --> 00:00:12.140
to determine what kind of
artificial intelligence projects

6
00:00:12.140 --> 00:00:15.170
will help your customers,
work in your company,

7
00:00:15.170 --> 00:00:17.570
and provide the most
return on your investment

8
00:00:17.570 --> 00:00:19.210
of time and energy.

9
00:00:19.210 --> 00:00:22.690
You are also prepared to choose
what role you want to play

10
00:00:22.690 --> 00:00:24.840
in implementing artificial intelligence.

11
00:00:24.840 --> 00:00:26.050
There are a lot of options.

12
00:00:26.050 --> 00:00:29.560
And you get to pick whichever
fit your temperament the best.

13
00:00:29.560 --> 00:00:32.230
I would like you to extend your education

14
00:00:32.230 --> 00:00:34.560
in whatever way makes sense for you.

15
00:00:34.560 --> 00:00:36.027
Start by taking a look at my book,

16
00:00:36.027 --> 00:00:38.050
"Artificial Intelligence for Marketing:

17
00:00:38.050 --> 00:00:40.430
Practical Applications."

18
00:00:40.430 --> 00:00:42.920
Check out other online
education opportunities

19
00:00:42.920 --> 00:00:46.350
and community organizations
like your university of choice

20
00:00:46.350 --> 00:00:50.090
or the Marketing Artificial
Intelligence Institute,

21
00:00:50.090 --> 00:00:53.460
which is marketingaiinstitute.com.

22
00:00:53.460 --> 00:00:56.320
And if you really want to
know more about data science

23
00:00:56.320 --> 00:00:58.790
and dig deeply into machine learning,

24
00:00:58.790 --> 00:00:59.971
I strongly recommend

25
00:00:59.971 --> 00:01:04.300
"This Week in Machine
Learning and AI TWIML."

26
00:01:04.300 --> 00:01:07.480
It's a podcast, TWIMLAI.com.

27
00:01:07.480 --> 00:01:09.420
It gets very deep very quickly,

28
00:01:09.420 --> 00:01:12.840
but it's a great way to learn
the language of data science

29
00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:14.420
but listening to how data scientists

30
00:01:14.420 --> 00:01:17.110
talk to other data scientists.

31
00:01:17.110 --> 00:01:18.022
It's eye-opening.

32
00:01:18.022 --> 00:01:22.420
I don't understand, hmm, maybe 70% of it.

33
00:01:22.420 --> 00:01:24.400
But it's really interesting to listen to.

34
00:01:24.400 --> 00:01:28.270
And now, I want you to do me a favor.

35
00:01:28.270 --> 00:01:30.300
Please get in touch with me directly

36
00:01:30.300 --> 00:01:32.170
and tell me about your progress

37
00:01:32.170 --> 00:01:33.980
in adopting artificial intelligence

38
00:01:33.980 --> 00:01:35.740
and machine learning for marketing.

39
00:01:35.740 --> 00:01:39.000
We're at the very beginning of
this new exciting technology.

40
00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:41.270
And sharing your experience with me

41
00:01:41.270 --> 00:01:43.710
will allow me to help others.

42
00:01:43.710 --> 00:01:47.820
So please email me at
jsterne@targeting.com

43
00:01:47.820 --> 00:01:50.300
or find me on Twitter @JimSterne

44
00:01:50.300 --> 00:01:54.223
because now it's my
turn to learn from you.
