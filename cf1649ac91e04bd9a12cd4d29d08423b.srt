00:00:00.270 --> 00:00:02.257
- Arthur C. Clarke famously said,

2
00:00:02.257 --> 00:00:04.557
"Any sufficiently advanced technology

3
00:00:04.557 --> 00:00:06.790
"is indistinguishable from magic."

4
00:00:06.790 --> 00:00:09.570
This couldn't be more true
for artificial intelligence.

5
00:00:09.570 --> 00:00:12.820
AI is so advanced that people
dedicate entire careers

6
00:00:12.820 --> 00:00:14.270
to understanding it.

7
00:00:14.270 --> 00:00:15.960
Now, I know what you might be thinking.

8
00:00:15.960 --> 00:00:18.380
How do you put machine
learning to work in marketing

9
00:00:18.380 --> 00:00:21.760
if you can't even converse
with a career data scientist?

10
00:00:21.760 --> 00:00:23.150
I want to help you understand

11
00:00:23.150 --> 00:00:25.290
what machine learning is in general,

12
00:00:25.290 --> 00:00:27.790
how it is different from
everything that came before it

13
00:00:27.790 --> 00:00:30.530
and how different flavors
of machine learning

14
00:00:30.530 --> 00:00:33.260
can solve different kinds of problems

15
00:00:33.260 --> 00:00:36.860
so you can start exploring
where and when to use it.

16
00:00:36.860 --> 00:00:39.150
Machine learning is a
new type of programming,

17
00:00:39.150 --> 00:00:41.620
a way of telling the computer
what you want it to do.

18
00:00:41.620 --> 00:00:44.570
We started with COBOL and FORTRAN and C,

19
00:00:44.570 --> 00:00:48.000
strict instructions to
be executed exactly.

20
00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:50.240
Next comes mathematical models,

21
00:00:50.240 --> 00:00:53.450
simple ones like your budget
in an Excel spreadsheet.

22
00:00:53.450 --> 00:00:55.680
Change the values to play what if games,

23
00:00:55.680 --> 00:00:57.070
even change the formulas,

24
00:00:57.070 --> 00:01:00.870
which are just short programs
linked from cell to cell.

25
00:01:00.870 --> 00:01:04.050
Beyond that comes predictive analytics.

26
00:01:04.050 --> 00:01:07.310
These are handcrafted statistical models

27
00:01:07.310 --> 00:01:09.500
built with lots of
assumptions and tweaking

28
00:01:09.500 --> 00:01:12.060
to make a model reflect
the real world well enough

29
00:01:12.060 --> 00:01:14.030
to make predictions.

30
00:01:14.030 --> 00:01:17.590
Machine learning is software
that looks at a pile of data

31
00:01:17.590 --> 00:01:20.190
and builds a model based on the data.

32
00:01:20.190 --> 00:01:22.780
It looks for patterns and derives rules

33
00:01:22.780 --> 00:01:25.320
about the data from the data

34
00:01:25.320 --> 00:01:28.690
and uses that to answer
questions or make predictions.

35
00:01:28.690 --> 00:01:31.940
The learning in machine
learning comes from the fact

36
00:01:31.940 --> 00:01:34.360
that it can change its mind.

37
00:01:34.360 --> 00:01:36.670
When new data shows up, it reassesses,

38
00:01:36.670 --> 00:01:37.970
looks for new patterns

39
00:01:37.970 --> 00:01:41.620
and updates its own
mathematical model of the world.

40
00:01:41.620 --> 00:01:45.570
Now, there are three broad
types of machine learning.

41
00:01:45.570 --> 00:01:48.120
The first is supervised learning.

42
00:01:48.120 --> 00:01:49.860
This is where you know the answer,

43
00:01:49.860 --> 00:01:51.770
give the machine lots and lots of examples

44
00:01:51.770 --> 00:01:53.480
and ask it questions like,

45
00:01:53.480 --> 00:01:56.300
is this a photo of a dog or a cat?

46
00:01:56.300 --> 00:01:59.000
Who out there looks like my best customer?

47
00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:02.750
Which of my customers are
best suited for upselling?

48
00:02:02.750 --> 00:02:06.100
Next is unsupervised learning.

49
00:02:06.100 --> 00:02:08.860
This is where you ask the
machine to tell you something

50
00:02:08.860 --> 00:02:10.230
that you didn't know.

51
00:02:10.230 --> 00:02:11.300
Find a pattern.

52
00:02:11.300 --> 00:02:14.540
Show me a correlation I wouldn't
have thought to look for.

53
00:02:14.540 --> 00:02:17.500
And finally, there's
reinforcement learning.

54
00:02:17.500 --> 00:02:18.990
This is a whole different animal.

55
00:02:18.990 --> 00:02:21.500
You give the machine a task and a goal

56
00:02:21.500 --> 00:02:24.930
and it makes changes
that improve the outcome.

57
00:02:24.930 --> 00:02:26.760
You want more email opens?

58
00:02:26.760 --> 00:02:29.400
The machine can crank out
a bunch of subject lines,

59
00:02:29.400 --> 00:02:30.960
see which ones get opened,

60
00:02:30.960 --> 00:02:33.670
then creates and tests subject lines

61
00:02:33.670 --> 00:02:36.160
that are more like the
ones that got opened.

62
00:02:36.160 --> 00:02:39.000
It learns from its own actions.

63
00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:40.920
Do you see the power here?

64
00:02:40.920 --> 00:02:44.150
We can teach the machine
to score prospects

65
00:02:44.150 --> 00:02:45.640
based on our customer data

66
00:02:45.640 --> 00:02:49.130
or determine what messaging
would be the best next action

67
00:02:49.130 --> 00:02:51.740
or qualify leads for the sales team

68
00:02:51.740 --> 00:02:53.600
or predict which prospects
are the most likely

69
00:02:53.600 --> 00:02:56.250
to be high lifetime value customers.

70
00:02:56.250 --> 00:02:58.860
Now it can seem pretty daunting

71
00:02:58.860 --> 00:03:01.130
to get started using machine learning,

72
00:03:01.130 --> 00:03:03.890
but actually it's not that difficult.

73
00:03:03.890 --> 00:03:06.070
Here's what I want you to do.

74
00:03:06.070 --> 00:03:08.670
Make a list of the tasks
that software like this

75
00:03:08.670 --> 00:03:10.730
might do for your company,

76
00:03:10.730 --> 00:03:14.080
what problems it could solve,
what barriers it could remove,

77
00:03:14.080 --> 00:03:17.910
what tasks it might be able to improve.

78
00:03:17.910 --> 00:03:21.260
You then prioritize that list
and start that conversation

79
00:03:21.260 --> 00:03:24.130
with your data scientists,
your consulting agencies,

80
00:03:24.130 --> 00:03:25.920
and your technology vendors.

81
00:03:25.920 --> 00:03:29.390
Once you have an idea of the
problems you'd like to solve,

82
00:03:29.390 --> 00:03:30.680
you'll be able to take advantage

83
00:03:30.680 --> 00:03:34.033
of this magical software
before you know it.
