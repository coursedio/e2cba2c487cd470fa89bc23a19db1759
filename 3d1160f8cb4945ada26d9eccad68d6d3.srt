00:00:00.247 --> 00:00:03.020
- "Alice in Wonderland" author
Lewis Carroll reminds us

2
00:00:03.020 --> 00:00:07.000
that if you don't know where
you're going, any road will do.

3
00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:08.430
This is critically important

4
00:00:08.430 --> 00:00:10.770
when dealing with artificial intelligence.

5
00:00:10.770 --> 00:00:13.300
I'm here to make sure your
project doesn't go off the rails

6
00:00:13.300 --> 00:00:16.870
due to a lack of clarity in goal setting.

7
00:00:16.870 --> 00:00:20.420
What happens when you
don't have clear goals?

8
00:00:20.420 --> 00:00:22.950
There's this old story of
an artificial intelligence

9
00:00:22.950 --> 00:00:25.310
tasked to run a paperclip factory

10
00:00:25.310 --> 00:00:28.440
with the goal of optimizing manufacturing.

11
00:00:28.440 --> 00:00:30.500
It streamlines shop floor control,

12
00:00:30.500 --> 00:00:32.330
tightens up the supply chain,

13
00:00:32.330 --> 00:00:34.270
masters the stock market to raise money

14
00:00:34.270 --> 00:00:35.960
to build another factory,

15
00:00:35.960 --> 00:00:37.480
and then it learns hypothetical physics

16
00:00:37.480 --> 00:00:38.750
so it can turn every molecule

17
00:00:38.750 --> 00:00:42.760
on planet Earth into
a paperclip, disaster.

18
00:00:42.760 --> 00:00:46.510
Or say you tune an
algorithm to get more clicks

19
00:00:46.510 --> 00:00:48.420
but it learns to write clickbait,

20
00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:52.460
which makes for a huge amount
of traffic and zero customers.

21
00:00:52.460 --> 00:00:53.640
Not good.

22
00:00:53.640 --> 00:00:57.050
Or you ask your AI system
to optimize for revenue.

23
00:00:57.050 --> 00:01:00.170
So it decides to sell $20
bills for a dollar each,

24
00:01:00.170 --> 00:01:02.130
thereby boosting revenue through the roof

25
00:01:02.130 --> 00:01:04.640
and you're fired.

26
00:01:04.640 --> 00:01:07.680
These are silly examples
of very real problems.

27
00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:09.580
You need to have crystal clear goals

28
00:01:09.580 --> 00:01:11.910
because this is artificial intelligence,

29
00:01:11.910 --> 00:01:13.510
not real intelligence.

30
00:01:13.510 --> 00:01:16.290
A computer only does what you ask it to.

31
00:01:16.290 --> 00:01:18.630
So break the business
problem down into smaller

32
00:01:18.630 --> 00:01:22.400
and smaller problems that
your data team can solve.

33
00:01:22.400 --> 00:01:23.500
The largest problem is

34
00:01:23.500 --> 00:01:26.400
that the CEO says, "We
need bigger profits."

35
00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:29.930
So the head of sales says, "For
that, we need better leads."

36
00:01:29.930 --> 00:01:31.727
And the CMO says, "For that,

37
00:01:31.727 --> 00:01:34.300
"we need better prospect segmentation."

38
00:01:34.300 --> 00:01:37.780
You, the savvy marketing
director, know that for that,

39
00:01:37.780 --> 00:01:39.500
you need to work with the data team

40
00:01:39.500 --> 00:01:41.750
who can make it happen using AI.

41
00:01:41.750 --> 00:01:43.300
You can use supervised learning

42
00:01:43.300 --> 00:01:46.260
to segment your best customers
based on your criteria.

43
00:01:46.260 --> 00:01:48.010
You can use unsupervised learning

44
00:01:48.010 --> 00:01:50.650
to figure out what your best
customers have in common

45
00:01:50.650 --> 00:01:52.290
and look for prospects who most

46
00:01:52.290 --> 00:01:55.040
closely resemble those best customers.

47
00:01:55.040 --> 00:01:57.050
Then you can use reinforcement learning

48
00:01:57.050 --> 00:02:00.060
to test which type of
prospects respond best

49
00:02:00.060 --> 00:02:02.700
to which messaging by micro segment.

50
00:02:02.700 --> 00:02:05.500
But you really need to
get into the weeds here.

51
00:02:05.500 --> 00:02:08.660
You want to test email subject lines?

52
00:02:08.660 --> 00:02:12.230
Great, but first you
need to define success.

53
00:02:12.230 --> 00:02:14.970
What outcome do you want to optimize?

54
00:02:14.970 --> 00:02:18.400
Opens, click-throughs,
conversions, loyalty?

55
00:02:18.400 --> 00:02:22.830
Marketing professionals know
the answer is all of the above.

56
00:02:22.830 --> 00:02:24.550
But the computer does not.

57
00:02:24.550 --> 00:02:30.070
You need to specify one goal
and one goal only very clearly.

58
00:02:30.070 --> 00:02:31.560
I want you to gather your team

59
00:02:31.560 --> 00:02:33.650
and pick a marketing
initiative that is supported

60
00:02:33.650 --> 00:02:36.310
by the highest executive around,

61
00:02:36.310 --> 00:02:38.230
break it down into its component parts,

62
00:02:38.230 --> 00:02:41.220
and pick one and only one task

63
00:02:41.220 --> 00:02:43.810
that is required to accomplish that part,

64
00:02:43.810 --> 00:02:45.780
and then ask yourself this.

65
00:02:45.780 --> 00:02:48.850
Which task would be best
served by an algorithm

66
00:02:48.850 --> 00:02:53.640
that could chew on this
problem day and night at scale?

67
00:02:53.640 --> 00:02:55.920
The data scientist can fly the plane.

68
00:02:55.920 --> 00:02:58.640
The analyst can provide the navigation.

69
00:02:58.640 --> 00:03:00.200
The data is the fuel.

70
00:03:00.200 --> 00:03:02.490
The algorithm is the engine.

71
00:03:02.490 --> 00:03:05.750
But you have to identify the destination.

72
00:03:05.750 --> 00:03:09.420
Having a clear goal in
mind, a clear destination,

73
00:03:09.420 --> 00:03:11.120
is how you get where you're going.
