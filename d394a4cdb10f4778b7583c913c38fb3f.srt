00:00:00.300 --> 00:00:01.700
- Self-driving cars and robots

2
00:00:01.700 --> 00:00:04.250
are always lumped into
artificial intelligence,

3
00:00:04.250 --> 00:00:06.480
even though they are not.

4
00:00:06.480 --> 00:00:10.070
It's important to understand
why they aren't really AI.

5
00:00:10.070 --> 00:00:12.730
Give me a minute, and I'll
help you understand AI

6
00:00:12.730 --> 00:00:15.370
and show you how
self-driving cars and robots

7
00:00:15.370 --> 00:00:17.570
actually will be part of marketing.

8
00:00:17.570 --> 00:00:19.670
Google Maps can tell
you how long it'll take

9
00:00:19.670 --> 00:00:21.290
to get where you're going.

10
00:00:21.290 --> 00:00:22.750
That is some serious heavy lifting,

11
00:00:22.750 --> 00:00:25.030
and is artificial intelligence.

12
00:00:25.030 --> 00:00:28.100
They use machine learning
to constantly improve.

13
00:00:28.100 --> 00:00:32.490
Talking to Siri or Alexa,
absolutely learning on the job.

14
00:00:32.490 --> 00:00:37.840
But most robots are just
machines executing instructions.

15
00:00:37.840 --> 00:00:40.090
Remember that remarkable video of Atlas

16
00:00:40.090 --> 00:00:43.330
from Boston dynamics where
it does that back flip?

17
00:00:43.330 --> 00:00:45.660
Amazing, but here's the thing.

18
00:00:45.660 --> 00:00:48.360
It didn't learn how to do a back flip.

19
00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:51.940
Its programmers learn how
to tweak the instructions

20
00:00:51.940 --> 00:00:53.830
so Atlas could amaze us.

21
00:00:53.830 --> 00:00:56.210
It took 50 tries.

22
00:00:56.210 --> 00:00:59.000
Self-driving cars use a
wide range of technologies

23
00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:00.110
to do what they do,

24
00:01:00.110 --> 00:01:01.890
and there is a great
deal of machine learning

25
00:01:01.890 --> 00:01:04.040
involved in their initial training.

26
00:01:04.040 --> 00:01:08.200
But if each car were
left to learn on its own,

27
00:01:08.200 --> 00:01:11.460
the product liability lawyers
would have a field day.

28
00:01:11.460 --> 00:01:14.050
So what can these almost
artificial intelligence things

29
00:01:14.050 --> 00:01:16.090
do for your marketing?

30
00:01:16.090 --> 00:01:19.460
If you run a service-only
or online-only business,

31
00:01:19.460 --> 00:01:21.210
robots aren't very helpful.

32
00:01:21.210 --> 00:01:23.120
But if your business is in person,

33
00:01:23.120 --> 00:01:24.560
there are a variety of ways

34
00:01:24.560 --> 00:01:27.640
they might be useful or entertaining.

35
00:01:27.640 --> 00:01:30.080
One Japanese hotel offers check-in

36
00:01:30.080 --> 00:01:33.690
with a pretty robot attendant
or a dinosaur robot.

37
00:01:33.690 --> 00:01:35.170
Fun!

38
00:01:35.170 --> 00:01:37.850
A porter robot takes your
luggage to your room,

39
00:01:37.850 --> 00:01:40.300
where you unlock the door with your face.

40
00:01:40.300 --> 00:01:41.360
Useful!

41
00:01:41.360 --> 00:01:43.050
No, robots can't make the bed

42
00:01:43.050 --> 00:01:47.300
or handle the wide variety
of concierge questions yet.

43
00:01:47.300 --> 00:01:48.620
But it's a start.

44
00:01:48.620 --> 00:01:51.680
And yes, Lowe's tried
customer service robots

45
00:01:51.680 --> 00:01:53.120
in their home improvement stores,

46
00:01:53.120 --> 00:01:55.300
and then went back to the drawing board.

47
00:01:55.300 --> 00:01:57.810
But these are all at the very start.

48
00:01:57.810 --> 00:01:59.310
If you run a store,

49
00:01:59.310 --> 00:02:00.620
start daydreaming now
(icons pop)

50
00:02:00.620 --> 00:02:03.810
about how a robot might help
deliver additional clothes

51
00:02:03.810 --> 00:02:05.220
to try on in the changing room,

52
00:02:05.220 --> 00:02:07.480
or restock the shelves on the main floor,

53
00:02:07.480 --> 00:02:10.510
or act as a follow me
around shopping cart.

54
00:02:10.510 --> 00:02:11.880
These ideas are all doable.

55
00:02:11.880 --> 00:02:13.450
It's just a question of choosing

56
00:02:13.450 --> 00:02:15.960
which ones will be the most useful

57
00:02:15.960 --> 00:02:18.670
and which people will like the most.

58
00:02:18.670 --> 00:02:22.700
Self-driving cars offer a
whole new promotional platform

59
00:02:22.700 --> 00:02:24.970
that deserves your attention.

60
00:02:24.970 --> 00:02:28.170
If people are not driving,
they are sleeping,

61
00:02:28.170 --> 00:02:29.700
working, watching entertainment,

62
00:02:29.700 --> 00:02:32.370
and in a perfect position for advertising.

63
00:02:32.370 --> 00:02:34.410
Maybe you create a branded app

64
00:02:34.410 --> 00:02:39.020
for meditation or in-car learning.

65
00:02:39.020 --> 00:02:41.320
You could offer
location-specific messaging

66
00:02:41.320 --> 00:02:43.440
and even coordinate those messages

67
00:02:43.440 --> 00:02:45.520
with electronic billboards.

68
00:02:45.520 --> 00:02:48.000
Or, "Hey Ashley, you have 45 minutes

69
00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:49.520
before your next appointment.

70
00:02:49.520 --> 00:02:51.590
Auto Realty would like to take you

71
00:02:51.590 --> 00:02:53.750
on a guided tour of homes for sale.

72
00:02:53.750 --> 00:02:55.100
Say yes and they'll give you

73
00:02:55.100 --> 00:02:58.220
a free inspection valuation
of your current home."

74
00:02:58.220 --> 00:03:00.720
Or, "Hey, Matthew, Kraft
would like to show you

75
00:03:00.720 --> 00:03:02.490
a simple recipe for macaroni and cheese

76
00:03:02.490 --> 00:03:03.840
that your kids will love.

77
00:03:03.840 --> 00:03:06.170
Say okay, and they'll
deliver the ingredients

78
00:03:06.170 --> 00:03:09.150
to your door and give you a 20% coupon."

79
00:03:09.150 --> 00:03:11.950
Or, "Hey Michael, there's
a Starbucks coming up.

80
00:03:11.950 --> 00:03:15.530
Say yes, and you can have
your pumpkin spice chai latte

81
00:03:15.530 --> 00:03:17.550
handed to you in two minutes."

82
00:03:17.550 --> 00:03:19.100
Yes, this stuff is off in the future.

83
00:03:19.100 --> 00:03:21.920
But now is the time to
start brainstorming.

84
00:03:21.920 --> 00:03:23.970
Because things are moving fast.

85
00:03:23.970 --> 00:03:26.920
Position yourself to be
ready and at the forefront.

86
00:03:26.920 --> 00:03:29.790
Your brand could get a huge PR bump

87
00:03:29.790 --> 00:03:32.700
by being the first to try something.

88
00:03:32.700 --> 00:03:35.950
What might you offer
that could make a splash?

89
00:03:35.950 --> 00:03:37.630
You may not think your brand has anything

90
00:03:37.630 --> 00:03:40.650
to do with self-driving
cars or robots yet,

91
00:03:40.650 --> 00:03:43.500
but now is the time to challenge yourself.

92
00:03:43.500 --> 00:03:46.373
It's not a matter of if, but when.
