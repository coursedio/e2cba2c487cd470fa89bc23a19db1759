1
00:00:00.310 --> 00:00:03.020
- Skynet from the "Terminator" learned

2
00:00:03.020 --> 00:00:08.400
at a geometric rate and became
self-aware in 3 1/2 weeks.

3
00:00:08.400 --> 00:00:11.130
In panic, humans tried to pull the plug.

4
00:00:11.130 --> 00:00:13.560
Skynet fought back.

5
00:00:13.560 --> 00:00:16.190
You are so much smarter

6
00:00:16.190 --> 00:00:18.840
than an artificial intelligence system.

7
00:00:18.840 --> 00:00:23.640
Can AI calculate lightning fast? Yes.

8
00:00:23.640 --> 00:00:26.750
Does it have common sense? No.

9
00:00:26.750 --> 00:00:30.470
Does AI have logic? Indubitably.

10
00:00:30.470 --> 00:00:33.580
Does it reason? It does not.

11
00:00:33.580 --> 00:00:38.080
Does AI possess curiosity? Not a trace.

12
00:00:38.080 --> 00:00:39.410
You're not going to be successful

13
00:00:39.410 --> 00:00:40.870
with artificial intelligence

14
00:00:40.870 --> 00:00:44.540
unless you understand where
it falls down on the job.

15
00:00:44.540 --> 00:00:46.240
Stick with me for a couple of minutes

16
00:00:46.240 --> 00:00:50.260
and you'll understand how
important you the human are

17
00:00:50.260 --> 00:00:54.360
to AI working well in marketing.

18
00:00:54.360 --> 00:00:58.200
Without empathy, common sense,
and emotional understanding,

19
00:00:58.200 --> 00:00:59.390
artificial intelligence is

20
00:00:59.390 --> 00:01:01.990
just blinking lights in clockwork.

21
00:01:01.990 --> 00:01:04.220
You add humanity to the picture,

22
00:01:04.220 --> 00:01:07.040
insight, inspiration, creativity.

23
00:01:07.040 --> 00:01:10.540
So your first job when
dealing with an AI system

24
00:01:10.540 --> 00:01:13.180
is all about the smell test.

25
00:01:13.180 --> 00:01:15.820
When the sophisticated AI model calculates

26
00:01:15.820 --> 00:01:19.940
that you would sell more
snow tires in the summer

27
00:01:19.940 --> 00:01:22.440
because, hey, there's no
competitive promotions,

28
00:01:22.440 --> 00:01:25.690
the smell test is quick
to point out the error.

29
00:01:25.690 --> 00:01:29.320
When your algorithm spits
out an auto response

30
00:01:29.320 --> 00:01:33.030
that the company does not
accept returns after 30 days,

31
00:01:33.030 --> 00:01:35.000
your smell test says, hold on there.

32
00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:36.610
This is one of our favorite customers

33
00:01:36.610 --> 00:01:38.450
or one of our most important clients

34
00:01:38.450 --> 00:01:41.030
or one of the most vocal influencers.

35
00:01:41.030 --> 00:01:45.470
We will happily accept
their return and apologize.

36
00:01:45.470 --> 00:01:48.760
The smell test uses
empathy, people skills,

37
00:01:48.760 --> 00:01:52.140
and sales tactics learned over the years,

38
00:01:52.140 --> 00:01:55.230
skills that only you the human possess.

39
00:01:55.230 --> 00:01:58.650
Your job, your superpower, is to identify

40
00:01:58.650 --> 00:02:00.950
what problem needs to be solved,

41
00:02:00.950 --> 00:02:03.860
invent and adopt new ideas,

42
00:02:03.860 --> 00:02:08.080
detect when the result
doesn't pass the smell test.

43
00:02:08.080 --> 00:02:12.160
The ability to look at
one thing and see another,

44
00:02:12.160 --> 00:02:17.100
the power of analogies, the
quest for new knowledge,

45
00:02:17.100 --> 00:02:18.410
these are the human traits

46
00:02:18.410 --> 00:02:20.910
that you must embrace and develop.

47
00:02:20.910 --> 00:02:24.920
They are what sets us
apart from the computer.

48
00:02:24.920 --> 00:02:26.830
You can strengthen your human talent

49
00:02:26.830 --> 00:02:29.810
with some cognitive exercises.

50
00:02:29.810 --> 00:02:33.230
Spot the relationships between things.

51
00:02:33.230 --> 00:02:35.290
How do things interrelate?

52
00:02:35.290 --> 00:02:37.400
Look at things from a different angle.

53
00:02:37.400 --> 00:02:41.070
What if they were upside
down or ran backwards?

54
00:02:41.070 --> 00:02:43.150
Read up on critical thinking.

55
00:02:43.150 --> 00:02:45.970
Am I keeping an open mind?

56
00:02:45.970 --> 00:02:47.300
Test your assumptions.

57
00:02:47.300 --> 00:02:50.570
What would disprove my belief?

58
00:02:50.570 --> 00:02:54.210
Spend one hour a week
studying cognitive bias

59
00:02:54.210 --> 00:02:58.010
to understand how your own
brain is tripping you up.

60
00:02:58.010 --> 00:03:02.070
AI is amazing, but humans are awesome.

61
00:03:02.070 --> 00:03:03.897
Just ask Shakespeare.

62
00:03:03.897 --> 00:03:06.380
"What a piece of work is man,

63
00:03:06.380 --> 00:03:10.300
how noble in reason,
how infinite in faculty,

64
00:03:10.300 --> 00:03:13.640
in form and moving how
express and admirable,

65
00:03:13.640 --> 00:03:15.620
in action how like an angel,

66
00:03:15.620 --> 00:03:18.697
in apprehension how like a god."
