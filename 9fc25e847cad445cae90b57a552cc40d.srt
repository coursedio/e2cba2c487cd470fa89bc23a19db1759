00:00:00.170 --> 00:00:03.210
- In 1993, Don Peppers and
Martha Rogers wrote a book

2
00:00:03.210 --> 00:00:05.770
called "The One to One Future".

3
00:00:05.770 --> 00:00:07.340
They only mention the internet in passing,

4
00:00:07.340 --> 00:00:09.890
because it was only 1993,

5
00:00:09.890 --> 00:00:12.100
but they laid out the
concept of using computers

6
00:00:12.100 --> 00:00:15.460
to communicate with individuals at scale.

7
00:00:15.460 --> 00:00:19.490
The concept was to treat each
person as a unique individual

8
00:00:19.490 --> 00:00:21.450
even though you're dealing with thousands

9
00:00:21.450 --> 00:00:23.330
of people at the same time.

10
00:00:23.330 --> 00:00:24.700
The idea is straightforward.

11
00:00:24.700 --> 00:00:26.710
When somebody shows up on your website,

12
00:00:26.710 --> 00:00:28.450
you show them whatever pictures

13
00:00:28.450 --> 00:00:31.340
and text might be the
most useful or persuasive

14
00:00:31.340 --> 00:00:32.810
in order to create a fabulous

15
00:00:32.810 --> 00:00:35.820
personalized customer experience.

16
00:00:35.820 --> 00:00:38.150
Everybody wants to be
treated as an individual.

17
00:00:38.150 --> 00:00:40.450
Everybody wants to be
recognized and remembered

18
00:00:40.450 --> 00:00:43.430
and have their specific
needs kept in mind.

19
00:00:43.430 --> 00:00:45.477
It's why we like going back
to the same restaurant.

20
00:00:45.477 --> 00:00:47.197
"Would you like the usual madam?"

21
00:00:47.197 --> 00:00:50.040
"Why yes, I would, thank you."

22
00:00:50.040 --> 00:00:52.050
I want to show you how machine learning

23
00:00:52.050 --> 00:00:55.640
can help your company get
better at personalization.

24
00:00:55.640 --> 00:00:58.160
You'll be able to convert
more prospects into customers,

25
00:00:58.160 --> 00:00:59.640
make your customers happier,

26
00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:03.080
make your company more profitable.

27
00:01:03.080 --> 00:01:06.900
The non-AI version starts
with you sitting in a room

28
00:01:06.900 --> 00:01:08.390
with the smartest people in your company

29
00:01:08.390 --> 00:01:10.380
and coming up with complex rules

30
00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:12.720
for what to show which people.

31
00:01:12.720 --> 00:01:14.920
If your customer lives
in a southern state,

32
00:01:14.920 --> 00:01:17.340
has purchased this pair of running shoes,

33
00:01:17.340 --> 00:01:21.040
and has recently visited a
competitive running shoe website,

34
00:01:21.040 --> 00:01:23.720
then you might want to show
them this particular content

35
00:01:23.720 --> 00:01:25.710
on the landing page, because you figure

36
00:01:25.710 --> 00:01:27.920
they're looking for a new pair of shoes,

37
00:01:27.920 --> 00:01:31.050
and you can guess which
ones they'll like the best.

38
00:01:31.050 --> 00:01:35.200
Or if your customer also purchased
this other pair of shoes,

39
00:01:35.200 --> 00:01:37.930
and they click on customer support,

40
00:01:37.930 --> 00:01:39.880
then you want to take them to the FAQ,

41
00:01:39.880 --> 00:01:41.480
frequently asked questions page,

42
00:01:41.480 --> 00:01:44.610
about that shoe failing in
the southern summer heat,

43
00:01:44.610 --> 00:01:47.240
because you can guess why they showed up.

44
00:01:47.240 --> 00:01:49.250
You can spend the rest
of your career coming up

45
00:01:49.250 --> 00:01:50.890
with scenarios like this.

46
00:01:50.890 --> 00:01:53.110
You could come up with
elaborate flowcharts

47
00:01:53.110 --> 00:01:55.640
about if they do this, then we think that.

48
00:01:55.640 --> 00:01:57.750
Some of it is professional experience

49
00:01:57.750 --> 00:02:01.210
garnered over time, and the
rest is just conjecture.

50
00:02:01.210 --> 00:02:04.820
But I want you to let that old way go.

51
00:02:04.820 --> 00:02:07.490
I want you to let machine
learning watch people

52
00:02:07.490 --> 00:02:10.310
coming to your website
and track as many traits

53
00:02:10.310 --> 00:02:14.240
and behaviors as it can,
and let it try new things.

54
00:02:14.240 --> 00:02:16.320
That's how machine learning works.

55
00:02:16.320 --> 00:02:17.550
It's how it learns.

56
00:02:17.550 --> 00:02:18.700
It tries things.

57
00:02:18.700 --> 00:02:21.190
And when something works, it
tries them again and again,

58
00:02:21.190 --> 00:02:24.650
and it improves, it learns.

59
00:02:24.650 --> 00:02:27.050
Over time, when somebody
comes to your website,

60
00:02:27.050 --> 00:02:29.270
the algorithm will have
the best possible content

61
00:02:29.270 --> 00:02:31.070
to show them provided you've given

62
00:02:31.070 --> 00:02:33.330
the algorithm enough to work with.

63
00:02:33.330 --> 00:02:35.730
Start by coming up with
a variety of personas

64
00:02:35.730 --> 00:02:39.750
and scenarios for which you
create a variety of content.

65
00:02:39.750 --> 00:02:42.090
Then you let the machine
learning algorithm mix

66
00:02:42.090 --> 00:02:43.830
and match your text and pictures

67
00:02:43.830 --> 00:02:46.980
to show a wide variety of visitors.

68
00:02:46.980 --> 00:02:50.630
In time, you'll see that it
can make real-time decisions

69
00:02:50.630 --> 00:02:52.440
to improve the customer experience

70
00:02:52.440 --> 00:02:55.780
and make you look like the
brilliant marketing professional

71
00:02:55.780 --> 00:02:56.973
you have become.
