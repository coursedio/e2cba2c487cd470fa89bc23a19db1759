00:00:00.300 --> 00:00:01.830
- We've all seen the movies,

2
00:00:01.830 --> 00:00:04.730
Skynet from "Terminator,"
Sonny from "I, Robot,"

3
00:00:04.730 --> 00:00:06.010
Andrew from "Bicentennial Man,"

4
00:00:06.010 --> 00:00:08.910
Samantha from "Her,"
the list goes on and on.

5
00:00:08.910 --> 00:00:11.230
And it confuses the conversation

6
00:00:11.230 --> 00:00:13.180
about artificial intelligence

7
00:00:13.180 --> 00:00:14.860
to where you need to be very clear

8
00:00:14.860 --> 00:00:17.730
on one critical distinction.

9
00:00:17.730 --> 00:00:21.380
There is general AI, which is
the stuff of science fiction,

10
00:00:21.380 --> 00:00:23.560
and there is functional AI,

11
00:00:23.560 --> 00:00:25.510
which is the stuff of business success

12
00:00:25.510 --> 00:00:27.380
and career advancement.

13
00:00:27.380 --> 00:00:29.780
I want you to fully
understand this difference,

14
00:00:29.780 --> 00:00:32.500
so you'll be on the educated
side of the conversation,

15
00:00:32.500 --> 00:00:34.320
you'll be taken seriously.

16
00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:37.400
You'll be identified as one who gets it.

17
00:00:37.400 --> 00:00:39.260
General artificial intelligence

18
00:00:39.260 --> 00:00:42.710
is the idea that machines will
eventually become self-aware.

19
00:00:42.710 --> 00:00:45.970
The theory is that the
computer learns fast enough.

20
00:00:45.970 --> 00:00:49.190
One day, it'll wake up
and take over the world.

21
00:00:49.190 --> 00:00:52.000
That's great for the
movies, but it's fiction.

22
00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:54.760
The systems we have today
are nowhere near capable

23
00:00:54.760 --> 00:00:57.520
of some of the simplest
things humans can do.

24
00:00:57.520 --> 00:01:00.710
And humans are complex
beyond our own understanding.

25
00:01:00.710 --> 00:01:03.870
One of the most powerful
methods of AI programming

26
00:01:03.870 --> 00:01:06.890
is based on how we think the brain works,

27
00:01:06.890 --> 00:01:08.860
but we don't really know.

28
00:01:08.860 --> 00:01:12.710
But even imitating how
we guess the brain works

29
00:01:12.710 --> 00:01:15.540
has resulted in systems
that are far more powerful

30
00:01:15.540 --> 00:01:18.630
than any other programming
we've had before.

31
00:01:18.630 --> 00:01:21.350
But they are only far more capable

32
00:01:21.350 --> 00:01:23.880
at very specific functions.

33
00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:26.640
They do not reason, they don't grow wise,

34
00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:29.210
they do not even have common sense.

35
00:01:29.210 --> 00:01:31.990
Can they do simultaneous
translation? Sure.

36
00:01:31.990 --> 00:01:36.070
Can they win at Jeopardy
and chess and go? Yes.

37
00:01:36.070 --> 00:01:39.550
But none of them can
do all of these things.

38
00:01:39.550 --> 00:01:41.640
So when you use AI to build a model

39
00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:43.240
to predict an outcome,

40
00:01:43.240 --> 00:01:46.230
or decide on an email subject line,

41
00:01:46.230 --> 00:01:49.990
that is functional AI,
and it is an awesome tool.

42
00:01:49.990 --> 00:01:53.270
But it's only a tool, not a handyman.

43
00:01:53.270 --> 00:01:55.010
It's a saw, not a carpenter.

44
00:01:55.010 --> 00:01:57.160
It's a paintbrush, not a painter.

45
00:01:57.160 --> 00:01:58.990
It can only do the specific task

46
00:01:58.990 --> 00:02:00.450
that it was built to do,

47
00:02:00.450 --> 00:02:02.980
but it does it really well, really fast,

48
00:02:02.980 --> 00:02:05.030
and it gets better over time.

49
00:02:05.030 --> 00:02:06.730
The kind of tasks that we're talking

50
00:02:06.730 --> 00:02:11.160
about are language, vision, robotics.

51
00:02:11.160 --> 00:02:13.810
These are AI's sweet spots.

52
00:02:13.810 --> 00:02:16.850
Natural language processing
has gotten much better lately.

53
00:02:16.850 --> 00:02:18.420
You can talk into your phone

54
00:02:18.420 --> 00:02:21.390
and it will translate
your voice into text.

55
00:02:21.390 --> 00:02:24.160
A conversation bot can imitate speech

56
00:02:24.160 --> 00:02:26.860
so we can converse with smart speakers.

57
00:02:26.860 --> 00:02:29.160
Computer vision lets you ask your computer

58
00:02:29.160 --> 00:02:31.890
for the photos that you've taken of dogs

59
00:02:31.890 --> 00:02:35.570
or people who are at the beach
or on my summer vacation.

60
00:02:35.570 --> 00:02:39.160
Computer vision can recognize
your logo on social media,

61
00:02:39.160 --> 00:02:41.460
even at an odd angle.

62
00:02:41.460 --> 00:02:43.760
Computer vision is getting good enough

63
00:02:43.760 --> 00:02:46.660
that we will be getting self-driving cars.

64
00:02:46.660 --> 00:02:49.750
And then there's machine learning.

65
00:02:49.750 --> 00:02:52.550
This is the heart of AI for marketing.

66
00:02:52.550 --> 00:02:54.350
Machine learning is the tool

67
00:02:54.350 --> 00:02:57.690
that can help you improve
prospect targeting,

68
00:02:57.690 --> 00:02:59.710
respond to inquiries faster,

69
00:02:59.710 --> 00:03:03.010
determine the next best
action for lead nurturing,

70
00:03:03.010 --> 00:03:05.160
qualify leads for the sales team.

71
00:03:05.160 --> 00:03:06.540
The list goes on.

72
00:03:06.540 --> 00:03:08.300
Machines are getting better and better

73
00:03:08.300 --> 00:03:11.260
at identifying patterns
and predicting outcomes,

74
00:03:11.260 --> 00:03:15.180
as long as you have a
very clear task for it.

75
00:03:15.180 --> 00:03:18.530
So imagine that you've just
hired a new marketing intern.

76
00:03:18.530 --> 00:03:20.420
What sort of tasks would you give somebody

77
00:03:20.420 --> 00:03:22.150
who is smart, learns quick,

78
00:03:22.150 --> 00:03:24.830
but doesn't really have
a lot of experience?

79
00:03:24.830 --> 00:03:28.170
What tasks would you give a fresh recruit?

80
00:03:28.170 --> 00:03:30.820
Make that list, it's the starting point

81
00:03:30.820 --> 00:03:33.823
to making artificial
intelligence work for you.
