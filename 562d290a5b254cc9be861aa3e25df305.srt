00:00:00.380 --> 00:00:01.730
- When you understand the power

2
00:00:01.730 --> 00:00:04.150
of artificial intelligence
and machine learning,

3
00:00:04.150 --> 00:00:07.220
and you start putting together
all those capabilities,

4
00:00:07.220 --> 00:00:10.550
you come up with some
pretty remarkable scenarios.

5
00:00:10.550 --> 00:00:12.910
Today, we already have devices

6
00:00:12.910 --> 00:00:15.250
that we can talk to and buy things.

7
00:00:15.250 --> 00:00:19.680
And those devices learn about
you and your ordering habits.

8
00:00:19.680 --> 00:00:22.940
You say, "Send more AA batteries."

9
00:00:22.940 --> 00:00:26.280
Computer has learned what
brand of batteries you prefer,

10
00:00:26.280 --> 00:00:29.300
how many batteries you
usually order and how often.

11
00:00:29.300 --> 00:00:31.870
So it knows what you want and can ask

12
00:00:31.870 --> 00:00:35.500
if you want to subscribe
and receive your usual brand

13
00:00:35.500 --> 00:00:38.320
in usual quantities at set periods

14
00:00:38.320 --> 00:00:39.740
based on your past purchases.

15
00:00:39.740 --> 00:00:41.080
Oh, and by the way,

16
00:00:41.080 --> 00:00:44.660
you can say 5% on the
price by subscribing.

17
00:00:44.660 --> 00:00:47.950
Today, you can point your
phone at products in stores

18
00:00:47.950 --> 00:00:49.610
and have more information

19
00:00:49.610 --> 00:00:52.090
about that product pop up on your screen.

20
00:00:52.090 --> 00:00:54.400
Today, you can walk into a restaurant

21
00:00:54.400 --> 00:00:56.560
and your usual order pops up on the screen

22
00:00:56.560 --> 00:00:59.560
because the algorithm
recognizes your face.

23
00:00:59.560 --> 00:01:01.890
Today, your email system can guess

24
00:01:01.890 --> 00:01:04.000
the rest of the sentence
that you're typing

25
00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:06.960
and you can let it fill in the blank.

26
00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:09.170
But what comes after that?

27
00:01:09.170 --> 00:01:12.010
The savvy marketer isn't
just planning for tomorrow.

28
00:01:12.010 --> 00:01:13.760
They're looking over the horizon

29
00:01:13.760 --> 00:01:17.260
to see what comes the day after tomorrow.

30
00:01:17.260 --> 00:01:21.110
And the day after tomorrow,
marketing gets weird.

31
00:01:21.110 --> 00:01:23.930
Given the difficulties that
we're having with online privacy

32
00:01:23.930 --> 00:01:25.800
and data protection, people are becoming

33
00:01:25.800 --> 00:01:28.210
more concerned about their data.

34
00:01:28.210 --> 00:01:31.860
Imagine a future where
you own your own data

35
00:01:31.860 --> 00:01:34.370
and you store your own data.

36
00:01:34.370 --> 00:01:36.320
And instead of giving your information

37
00:01:36.320 --> 00:01:39.840
to each website and each
company and each app,

38
00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:42.250
you give them access to specific parts

39
00:01:42.250 --> 00:01:44.260
of your personal data.

40
00:01:44.260 --> 00:01:46.570
When you update some piece of information,

41
00:01:46.570 --> 00:01:49.690
every app and website you
have permitted can access it,

42
00:01:49.690 --> 00:01:52.770
and so will never be out of date.

43
00:01:52.770 --> 00:01:55.330
Now, this is your data.

44
00:01:55.330 --> 00:01:57.680
It belongs to you and it's secure.

45
00:01:57.680 --> 00:02:01.260
Now imagine that you have your
own artificial intelligent

46
00:02:01.260 --> 00:02:04.230
agent on top of that data

47
00:02:04.230 --> 00:02:06.510
and it operates on your behalf.

48
00:02:06.510 --> 00:02:09.557
The day will come when your agent says,

49
00:02:09.557 --> 00:02:12.700
"I see that your dishwasher
has a 90% chance of failing

50
00:02:12.700 --> 00:02:14.130
in the next 60 days.

51
00:02:14.130 --> 00:02:16.800
I have found 12 highly rated dishwashers

52
00:02:16.800 --> 00:02:18.330
that will fit in your kitchen,

53
00:02:18.330 --> 00:02:21.200
five of which will fit
in your decorating style.

54
00:02:21.200 --> 00:02:23.930
I have negotiated with four
of them to fit your budget.

55
00:02:23.930 --> 00:02:27.550
And two of them will fit your
schedule for installation."

56
00:02:27.550 --> 00:02:30.610
Between the two, I recommend
the one serviced by a company

57
00:02:30.610 --> 00:02:32.150
five miles from your house,

58
00:02:32.150 --> 00:02:34.710
rather than the 175 miles away.

59
00:02:34.710 --> 00:02:36.600
Would you like the recommended dishwasher

60
00:02:36.600 --> 00:02:38.010
installed next Thursday

61
00:02:38.010 --> 00:02:40.330
or would you like to see more details?"

62
00:02:40.330 --> 00:02:43.070
That's marketing in the future.

63
00:02:43.070 --> 00:02:45.760
That means you have to wrap
your mind around the idea

64
00:02:45.760 --> 00:02:48.380
of machine-to-machine marketing.

65
00:02:48.380 --> 00:02:50.350
You will have to create systems

66
00:02:50.350 --> 00:02:53.670
that can communicate with
your customers' systems

67
00:02:53.670 --> 00:02:55.300
because you might no longer

68
00:02:55.300 --> 00:02:57.830
have direct access to those prospects.

69
00:02:57.830 --> 00:03:00.040
The most important part of your job

70
00:03:00.040 --> 00:03:03.270
will be branding so that your customer

71
00:03:03.270 --> 00:03:05.470
prefers your brand name,

72
00:03:05.470 --> 00:03:08.600
regardless of how far away
your service center is.

73
00:03:08.600 --> 00:03:10.270
So start thinking about it now

74
00:03:10.270 --> 00:03:12.110
and implement what you can,

75
00:03:12.110 --> 00:03:14.150
so you don't fall behind.

76
00:03:14.150 --> 00:03:17.560
It's going to be a wild and
wonderful and exciting time.

77
00:03:17.560 --> 00:03:20.250
And I can't wait to see what we invent,

78
00:03:20.250 --> 00:03:22.473
what you invent tomorrow.
