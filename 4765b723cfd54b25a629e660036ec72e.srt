1
00:00:00.590 --> 00:00:04.470
- It's a classic problem, buy or build.

2
00:00:04.470 --> 00:00:06.160
Some people are do it yourselfers

3
00:00:06.160 --> 00:00:08.800
and prefer to fix that
leaky faucet themselves,

4
00:00:08.800 --> 00:00:10.550
to be sure it's done right.

5
00:00:10.550 --> 00:00:14.090
And some, like me, prefer to
have a professional plumber

6
00:00:14.090 --> 00:00:15.220
fix that leaky faucet

7
00:00:15.220 --> 00:00:18.810
because I want to make
sure it's done right.

8
00:00:18.810 --> 00:00:20.010
When it comes to succeeding

9
00:00:20.010 --> 00:00:22.310
with artificial intelligence in marketing,

10
00:00:22.310 --> 00:00:24.370
do you hire a bunch of data scientists

11
00:00:24.370 --> 00:00:27.350
to build an AI system from scratch?

12
00:00:27.350 --> 00:00:29.000
Do you assemble a variety

13
00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:31.130
of AI components and create your own

14
00:00:31.130 --> 00:00:34.610
artificially intelligent
marketing ecosystem?

15
00:00:34.610 --> 00:00:37.780
Or do you license some pre-built platform

16
00:00:37.780 --> 00:00:40.270
that promises to do it all for you?

17
00:00:40.270 --> 00:00:42.700
I want to give you a couple
of things to consider

18
00:00:42.700 --> 00:00:46.170
when answering the question, buy or build.

19
00:00:46.170 --> 00:00:48.410
If you work in a huge corporation,

20
00:00:48.410 --> 00:00:50.940
you likely already have scientists

21
00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:55.310
working on AI for finance,
human resources, manufacturing.

22
00:00:55.310 --> 00:00:57.520
They might have data sciences on board

23
00:00:57.520 --> 00:00:58.810
because their brand,

24
00:00:58.810 --> 00:01:01.520
their image in the marketplace demands it.

25
00:01:01.520 --> 00:01:03.830
Amazon, Google, IBM, Microsoft,

26
00:01:03.830 --> 00:01:06.130
they can't outsource their brain trust.

27
00:01:06.130 --> 00:01:08.260
They want to sell this stuff to others,

28
00:01:08.260 --> 00:01:10.770
so they have to use their own technology.

29
00:01:10.770 --> 00:01:12.710
If you work in a big corporation,

30
00:01:12.710 --> 00:01:15.400
it's likely they already have
teams of people assembled

31
00:01:15.400 --> 00:01:17.720
to master new methods like AI

32
00:01:17.720 --> 00:01:20.880
to increase the company's
overall capabilities.

33
00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:23.330
They might not have tackled marketing yet.

34
00:01:23.330 --> 00:01:26.775
Come up with a pitch for
why they should spend

35
00:01:26.775 --> 00:01:27.650
some time building AI for marketing,

36
00:01:27.650 --> 00:01:29.250
and you'll get their attention.

37
00:01:29.250 --> 00:01:31.170
If you're a small company,

38
00:01:31.170 --> 00:01:32.240
there's no way you can afford

39
00:01:32.240 --> 00:01:34.520
to hire even half a day to scientist.

40
00:01:34.520 --> 00:01:36.900
So just grab the off the shelf system

41
00:01:36.900 --> 00:01:38.840
that solves whatever particular problem

42
00:01:38.840 --> 00:01:41.350
you're facing at the moment.

43
00:01:41.350 --> 00:01:43.900
If your organization is
somewhere in the middle,

44
00:01:43.900 --> 00:01:46.260
you'll need to consider
your corporate culture

45
00:01:46.260 --> 00:01:48.660
and balance the need for instant results

46
00:01:48.660 --> 00:01:51.570
with the need to build internal know-how.

47
00:01:51.570 --> 00:01:52.870
If you have the time,

48
00:01:52.870 --> 00:01:55.870
the political capital,
and the competitive need,

49
00:01:55.870 --> 00:01:58.600
by all means, go out and
hire some data scientists.

50
00:01:58.600 --> 00:02:00.550
Just be sure your budget can handle it,

51
00:02:00.550 --> 00:02:03.360
and that you can afford the time it takes

52
00:02:03.360 --> 00:02:07.130
to find those rare individuals
and get them up to speed.

53
00:02:07.130 --> 00:02:09.920
Now be aware you may
already be using systems

54
00:02:09.920 --> 00:02:12.920
that have AI built in.

55
00:02:12.920 --> 00:02:16.130
IBM has plugged Watson into
all the software they sell.

56
00:02:16.130 --> 00:02:19.380
Adobe has Sensei for
Photoshop and Adobe Analytics.

57
00:02:19.380 --> 00:02:20.700
Salesforce has Einstein.

58
00:02:20.700 --> 00:02:24.010
HubSpot has their content strategy module.

59
00:02:24.010 --> 00:02:27.760
So your first decision
is based on company size.

60
00:02:27.760 --> 00:02:29.780
Giant corporation, do some digging

61
00:02:29.780 --> 00:02:31.860
and find your data science team.

62
00:02:31.860 --> 00:02:35.290
Find out what software your
company is already using.

63
00:02:35.290 --> 00:02:36.600
You'll be surprised how many people

64
00:02:36.600 --> 00:02:38.960
are using different tools
in different departments

65
00:02:38.960 --> 00:02:40.760
and don't know about each other.

66
00:02:40.760 --> 00:02:44.165
And finally, but perhaps most importantly,

67
00:02:44.165 --> 00:02:46.580
ask yourself if you want to do a deep dive

68
00:02:46.580 --> 00:02:49.130
and learn how to build AI systems.

69
00:02:49.130 --> 00:02:51.470
Do you want to bring
together a variety of tools

70
00:02:51.470 --> 00:02:54.210
into your marketing,
computing environment?

71
00:02:54.210 --> 00:02:56.710
You could build your own martech stack,

72
00:02:56.710 --> 00:02:58.210
or do you just want to increase

73
00:02:58.210 --> 00:02:59.720
your return on marketing spend,

74
00:02:59.720 --> 00:03:01.540
make your email campaigns more effective

75
00:03:01.540 --> 00:03:04.020
or boost customer retention?

76
00:03:04.020 --> 00:03:06.500
If so, there are a lot of venture capital

77
00:03:06.500 --> 00:03:08.620
backed tools on the market

78
00:03:08.620 --> 00:03:11.090
you can pick up and run with right away.

79
00:03:11.090 --> 00:03:13.830
Let your personal interest
in artificial intelligence

80
00:03:13.830 --> 00:03:16.650
be your guide and you will
be much more effective

81
00:03:16.650 --> 00:03:20.210
in getting AI to help
you do marketing faster,

82
00:03:20.210 --> 00:03:22.563
cheaper, and at scale.
