00:00:00.280 --> 00:00:02.980
- Artificial intelligence
is tremendously useful

2
00:00:02.980 --> 00:00:05.670
for marketing, and I'm
glad you're interested.

3
00:00:05.670 --> 00:00:08.930
Rest assured that AI is not
going to take over the world

4
00:00:08.930 --> 00:00:11.980
and enslave mankind, it's
not going to take your job.

5
00:00:11.980 --> 00:00:13.750
That's just not going to happen.

6
00:00:13.750 --> 00:00:17.060
It is going to take
over some of your tasks

7
00:00:17.060 --> 00:00:20.240
so that you can do your job
better, faster, and cheaper.

8
00:00:20.240 --> 00:00:22.860
But there's some things
that you need to be aware of

9
00:00:22.860 --> 00:00:24.890
when you want to use AI.

10
00:00:24.890 --> 00:00:26.860
I can help you avoid
some of the speed bumps

11
00:00:26.860 --> 00:00:29.250
and the potholes in just
a couple of minutes.

12
00:00:29.250 --> 00:00:32.867
Start by remembering what
economist Leo Cherne said.

13
00:00:32.867 --> 00:00:37.207
"Computers are incredibly fast,
fast, accurate, and stupid,

14
00:00:37.207 --> 00:00:41.807
"while humans are slow,
error-prone, and brilliant.

15
00:00:41.807 --> 00:00:45.940
"The marriage of the two is
a force beyond calculation."

16
00:00:45.940 --> 00:00:49.020
Yes, even artificial intelligence is dumb.

17
00:00:49.020 --> 00:00:50.780
It can only do what you tell it

18
00:00:50.780 --> 00:00:53.620
and it does not know if
the answer is reasonable.

19
00:00:53.620 --> 00:00:56.080
It's really good at telling good from bad,

20
00:00:56.080 --> 00:00:58.810
but it hasn't got a clue
about right from wrong.

21
00:00:58.810 --> 00:01:02.240
If you tell the machine that
you want more email opens,

22
00:01:02.240 --> 00:01:03.890
the algorithm might figure out

23
00:01:03.890 --> 00:01:07.680
that sending everybody 1,000
emails gets more of them open.

24
00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:11.550
That could be true, but it's
not helpful, it's not useful.

25
00:01:11.550 --> 00:01:14.490
So you have to be very
clear about your goals

26
00:01:14.490 --> 00:01:15.850
with artificial intelligence.

27
00:01:15.850 --> 00:01:19.340
What specifically do you
want it to do for you?

28
00:01:19.340 --> 00:01:23.480
Next, you've got to give the
machine the best data you can.

29
00:01:23.480 --> 00:01:26.800
Good data is clean and
reliable and abundant

30
00:01:26.800 --> 00:01:29.600
and of the proper variety.

31
00:01:29.600 --> 00:01:31.430
You may have a million customers,

32
00:01:31.430 --> 00:01:33.250
but it's the variety of what you know

33
00:01:33.250 --> 00:01:35.640
about those customers that matters.

34
00:01:35.640 --> 00:01:37.540
Name and address won't tell you very much,

35
00:01:37.540 --> 00:01:40.430
but name, address, time
of day they contact you,

36
00:01:40.430 --> 00:01:42.620
and what they look at on your website

37
00:01:42.620 --> 00:01:46.530
starts to get predictive of
what and when they might buy.

38
00:01:46.530 --> 00:01:49.200
Too little information is not helpful.

39
00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:54.070
The machine will just be
highly confident, but wrong.

40
00:01:54.070 --> 00:01:55.830
Too many data types,

41
00:01:55.830 --> 00:01:57.650
and the machine won't be confident at all,

42
00:01:57.650 --> 00:01:59.440
it's just all noise.

43
00:01:59.440 --> 00:02:03.050
It's up to you to find the
right assortment of data

44
00:02:03.050 --> 00:02:06.130
for the machine to answer
your questions well.

45
00:02:06.130 --> 00:02:10.070
The other troubling thing about
data is that it is biased.

46
00:02:10.070 --> 00:02:11.810
A group of data scientists at Amazon

47
00:02:11.810 --> 00:02:14.430
asked the machine to
filter out the resumes

48
00:02:14.430 --> 00:02:15.910
of people who were not likely

49
00:02:15.910 --> 00:02:19.070
to be successful Amazon employees.

50
00:02:19.070 --> 00:02:22.570
Success was I find based
on a lot of factors,

51
00:02:22.570 --> 00:02:24.290
including the number of promotions,

52
00:02:24.290 --> 00:02:25.830
the number of direct reports,

53
00:02:25.830 --> 00:02:29.440
glowing reviews, years
of service, the usual.

54
00:02:29.440 --> 00:02:34.640
But the results were a pile of
resumes of only white males.

55
00:02:34.640 --> 00:02:37.450
The bias built into the data

56
00:02:37.450 --> 00:02:39.890
uncovered their diversity problems.

57
00:02:39.890 --> 00:02:42.450
So Amazon had to throw out that algorithm

58
00:02:42.450 --> 00:02:45.600
to guard against future bias.

59
00:02:45.600 --> 00:02:47.840
Finally, this is a tool,

60
00:02:47.840 --> 00:02:50.800
and all tools can be used for good or ill.

61
00:02:50.800 --> 00:02:52.770
Should we be afraid of AI?

62
00:02:52.770 --> 00:02:53.930
Not at all.

63
00:02:53.930 --> 00:02:55.830
Should we be we afraid of bad actors

64
00:02:55.830 --> 00:03:00.700
using AI to defraud people,
mess with our election process,

65
00:03:00.700 --> 00:03:02.930
turn a blind eye to discrimination?

66
00:03:02.930 --> 00:03:04.670
Yes, we should.

67
00:03:04.670 --> 00:03:06.430
So it's on you to make sure

68
00:03:06.430 --> 00:03:10.670
that your projects are
well-defined, your data is diverse,

69
00:03:10.670 --> 00:03:11.810
and that you are making sure

70
00:03:11.810 --> 00:03:14.270
the machine doesn't do the
wrong thing by accident

71
00:03:14.270 --> 00:03:16.640
or fall into the wrong hands.

72
00:03:16.640 --> 00:03:18.490
Keep those things top of mind

73
00:03:18.490 --> 00:03:22.430
and you can use AI to become
more valuable to your company

74
00:03:22.430 --> 00:03:24.373
and make your company more successful.
