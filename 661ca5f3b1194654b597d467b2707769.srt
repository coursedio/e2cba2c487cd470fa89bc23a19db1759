00:00:00.120 --> 00:00:02.750
- One of my favorite Isaac Asimov quotes

2
00:00:02.750 --> 00:00:04.980
is, the most exciting phrase

3
00:00:04.980 --> 00:00:08.720
that heralds new discoveries
is not eureka, I have found it,

4
00:00:08.720 --> 00:00:11.340
but hmm, that's funny.

5
00:00:11.340 --> 00:00:13.900
Unsupervised learning was invented

6
00:00:13.900 --> 00:00:16.250
to show you what's funny.

7
00:00:16.250 --> 00:00:18.660
Unsupervised learning is where you give

8
00:00:18.660 --> 00:00:20.510
the computer a big pile of data

9
00:00:20.510 --> 00:00:23.630
and ask it to tell you
something you didn't know.

10
00:00:23.630 --> 00:00:24.830
If you have enough data,

11
00:00:24.830 --> 00:00:26.690
then you'll have a clear
enough understanding

12
00:00:26.690 --> 00:00:29.330
of your industry and your customers,

13
00:00:29.330 --> 00:00:31.320
unsupervised learning can unlock doors

14
00:00:31.320 --> 00:00:33.690
in super powerful ways.

15
00:00:33.690 --> 00:00:35.950
Given everything you know
about your customers,

16
00:00:35.950 --> 00:00:38.970
is there a pattern, are there outliers,

17
00:00:38.970 --> 00:00:40.360
what do they have in common?

18
00:00:40.360 --> 00:00:42.210
What sets them apart?

19
00:00:42.210 --> 00:00:44.220
Unsupervised learning doesn't come up

20
00:00:44.220 --> 00:00:45.270
with insightful answers

21
00:00:45.270 --> 00:00:47.400
to a marketing professional's questions,

22
00:00:47.400 --> 00:00:50.010
it just comes up with
interesting correlations,

23
00:00:50.010 --> 00:00:53.140
like more of your
customers are named Susan

24
00:00:53.140 --> 00:00:54.970
than any other name.

25
00:00:54.970 --> 00:00:58.030
People who buy headphones buy more music.

26
00:00:58.030 --> 00:01:00.280
People buy more stuff online

27
00:01:00.280 --> 00:01:01.960
when the weather is bad.

28
00:01:01.960 --> 00:01:04.330
The computer is right, but these things

29
00:01:04.330 --> 00:01:06.970
are obvious, irrelevant and useless,

30
00:01:06.970 --> 00:01:08.930
thank you Captain Obvious.

31
00:01:08.930 --> 00:01:11.610
It might also come up
with other correlations

32
00:01:11.610 --> 00:01:15.200
like the further away from
the store people live,

33
00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:19.550
the more expensive the
items that they buy online.

34
00:01:19.550 --> 00:01:21.560
Or, there's a cluster of online customers

35
00:01:21.560 --> 00:01:23.890
in Toronto who buy your products.

36
00:01:23.890 --> 00:01:27.070
Or, people who open mail number 27

37
00:01:27.070 --> 00:01:29.050
and looked at products A and B

38
00:01:29.050 --> 00:01:31.400
are 50% more likely to add product C

39
00:01:31.400 --> 00:01:32.660
to their shopping cart.

40
00:01:32.660 --> 00:01:35.250
All right, now we're talking.

41
00:01:35.250 --> 00:01:36.740
If people who live further away

42
00:01:36.740 --> 00:01:40.090
from the store buy more
expensive items online,

43
00:01:40.090 --> 00:01:41.750
then we can promote different items

44
00:01:41.750 --> 00:01:44.140
in our direct mail
catalogs, our email blasts,

45
00:01:44.140 --> 00:01:47.280
and ad campaigns based on zip codes closer

46
00:01:47.280 --> 00:01:49.330
to and further away from the store.

47
00:01:49.330 --> 00:01:51.510
We should test that.

48
00:01:51.510 --> 00:01:53.048
There is a cluster of online customers

49
00:01:53.048 --> 00:01:55.430
in Toronto who buy our products.

50
00:01:55.430 --> 00:01:58.490
We have a bunch of
customers, but no store,

51
00:01:58.490 --> 00:02:00.040
we should build one.

52
00:02:00.040 --> 00:02:02.810
People who opened that particular email

53
00:02:02.810 --> 00:02:04.720
and looked at those
products were more likely

54
00:02:04.720 --> 00:02:06.390
to buy product C?

55
00:02:06.390 --> 00:02:09.910
Man, we can boost sales
based on that tomorrow.

56
00:02:09.910 --> 00:02:12.560
You see, inspiration comes from applying

57
00:02:12.560 --> 00:02:15.640
what you know in one area to another.

58
00:02:15.640 --> 00:02:19.370
When unsupervised learning
unearths weird correlations

59
00:02:19.370 --> 00:02:22.390
in the data, your analytics skills kick in

60
00:02:22.390 --> 00:02:24.790
and provide the context, the meaning,

61
00:02:24.790 --> 00:02:26.780
and the implications.

62
00:02:26.780 --> 00:02:29.540
Your computer might tell
you something boring,

63
00:02:29.540 --> 00:02:31.930
people carry umbrellas when it rains.

64
00:02:31.930 --> 00:02:34.640
Or it might tell you
something so compelling

65
00:02:34.640 --> 00:02:37.640
that you might change your
advertising messaging,

66
00:02:37.640 --> 00:02:39.580
identify a new customer base,

67
00:02:39.580 --> 00:02:41.950
or even invent a whole new product line.

68
00:02:41.950 --> 00:02:45.510
So, where do you have
a lot of customer data?

69
00:02:45.510 --> 00:02:49.030
Where might you get more
data about your marketplace?

70
00:02:49.030 --> 00:02:50.560
Gather it together,

71
00:02:50.560 --> 00:02:54.100
give it an unsupervised learning algorithm

72
00:02:54.100 --> 00:02:57.170
and let it show you
something you didn't know.

73
00:02:57.170 --> 00:03:01.490
See, if the results make
you say hmm, that's funny,

74
00:03:01.490 --> 00:03:04.663
then you know you're onto a new discovery.
