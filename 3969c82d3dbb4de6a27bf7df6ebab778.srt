00:00:00.320 --> 00:00:03.760
- Conversation bots have been
struggling to gain respect.

2
00:00:03.760 --> 00:00:05.940
They've been so lame for so long

3
00:00:05.940 --> 00:00:08.610
that the popular meme is what do we want?

4
00:00:08.610 --> 00:00:09.520
Chat bots.

5
00:00:09.520 --> 00:00:10.640
When do we want them?

6
00:00:10.640 --> 00:00:13.850
I'm sorry, I didn't
understand the question.

7
00:00:13.850 --> 00:00:16.050
The chat bots are getting better.

8
00:00:16.050 --> 00:00:17.210
They are learning.

9
00:00:17.210 --> 00:00:20.220
These tools are great for
answering your customers'

10
00:00:20.220 --> 00:00:22.170
frequently asked questions.

11
00:00:22.170 --> 00:00:24.680
You can give your bot
all the right answers.

12
00:00:24.680 --> 00:00:26.240
And then, instead of coming up

13
00:00:26.240 --> 00:00:28.930
with a thousand different
ways people might ask,

14
00:00:28.930 --> 00:00:30.808
the bot learns how people ask

15
00:00:30.808 --> 00:00:33.960
the same question in thousands of ways.

16
00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:35.400
Does it come in brown?

17
00:00:35.400 --> 00:00:36.720
Do you have a brown one?

18
00:00:36.720 --> 00:00:38.050
Can I get it in brown?

19
00:00:38.050 --> 00:00:39.200
How about brown?

20
00:00:39.200 --> 00:00:42.299
Chocolate, coffee, dark tan?

21
00:00:42.299 --> 00:00:45.120
Chatbots are being used
to great effect conversing

22
00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:48.240
with customers, offering
instant customer service,

23
00:00:48.240 --> 00:00:51.170
and actually helping your
customer service teams,

24
00:00:51.170 --> 00:00:52.940
not replacing them.

25
00:00:52.940 --> 00:00:55.930
A travel company found that
people are full of questions.

26
00:00:55.930 --> 00:00:57.650
The same questions again and again

27
00:00:57.650 --> 00:01:00.380
about their flight or their hotel.

28
00:01:00.380 --> 00:01:02.520
Instead of having
employees waste their time

29
00:01:02.520 --> 00:01:05.740
repeating the same answers
to the same questions,

30
00:01:05.740 --> 00:01:08.253
the company implemented chatbots.

31
00:01:08.253 --> 00:01:12.030
By having employees tackle
only the toughest questions,

32
00:01:12.030 --> 00:01:13.310
they increased bookings.

33
00:01:13.310 --> 00:01:15.340
When questions have specific answers,

34
00:01:15.340 --> 00:01:18.010
chatbots are well worth the effort.

35
00:01:18.010 --> 00:01:21.410
Another example is a
popular cosmetics retailer

36
00:01:21.410 --> 00:01:23.280
that built a bot that interviews people

37
00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:26.410
about their makeup
preferences, their skin color,

38
00:01:26.410 --> 00:01:28.070
and a few questions about where they fall

39
00:01:28.070 --> 00:01:31.520
on the conservative to
daring style spectrum.

40
00:01:31.520 --> 00:01:33.050
Then it recommends different products

41
00:01:33.050 --> 00:01:35.650
and colors in the way a sales clerk might.

42
00:01:35.650 --> 00:01:38.770
Then, it uses the customer's camera

43
00:01:38.770 --> 00:01:41.010
to display different lipstick colors

44
00:01:41.010 --> 00:01:43.400
in real time on your face.

45
00:01:43.400 --> 00:01:45.630
The result, more sales.

46
00:01:45.630 --> 00:01:48.710
One office supply company
lets customers order products

47
00:01:48.710 --> 00:01:52.320
with voice or text or even with a photo.

48
00:01:52.320 --> 00:01:55.470
And when you say that you want blue pens,

49
00:01:55.470 --> 00:01:57.350
it's already learned what sort of pens

50
00:01:57.350 --> 00:01:59.450
and how many you usually order.

51
00:01:59.450 --> 00:02:04.210
Time saved, happy customer,
tiny customer service cost.

52
00:02:04.210 --> 00:02:06.710
To prove how advanced
this stuff is getting,

53
00:02:06.710 --> 00:02:11.350
you can now instruct Google
Duplex to make you a reservation

54
00:02:11.350 --> 00:02:14.250
at a restaurant that
has no online booking.

55
00:02:14.250 --> 00:02:16.890
It will call the restaurant on the phone,

56
00:02:16.890 --> 00:02:18.960
talk to the person who answers,

57
00:02:18.960 --> 00:02:20.910
and engage them in conversation.

58
00:02:20.910 --> 00:02:23.990
It understands what's being
said by the human and responds

59
00:02:23.990 --> 00:02:29.110
in real time, including uhs
and ums, to sound more human.

60
00:02:29.110 --> 00:02:32.610
Think about how chatbots
might help take your company

61
00:02:32.610 --> 00:02:34.550
to the next level.

62
00:02:34.550 --> 00:02:35.540
Perhaps you have lots

63
00:02:35.540 --> 00:02:38.050
of customers contacting you all the time.

64
00:02:38.050 --> 00:02:39.890
Maybe you are overwhelmed

65
00:02:39.890 --> 00:02:42.760
with people asking the
same thing over and over.

66
00:02:42.760 --> 00:02:47.490
If you can map out the flow of
a sales clerk's conversation,

67
00:02:47.490 --> 00:02:50.140
then you can choose which
of these ways chatbots

68
00:02:50.140 --> 00:02:52.550
should be put to use first

69
00:02:52.550 --> 00:02:56.083
to help you be more successful at scale.
