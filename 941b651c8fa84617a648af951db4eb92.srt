1
00:00:00.260 --> 00:00:02.480
- Hollywood loves to
make movies about robots

2
00:00:02.480 --> 00:00:05.780
that miraculously develop
integrated cognition.

3
00:00:05.780 --> 00:00:08.340
Wall-E, the robot who learns to love,

4
00:00:08.340 --> 00:00:11.030
Dolores from Westworld who seeks revenge,

5
00:00:11.030 --> 00:00:15.350
or even R2-D2's distinct
loyalty to the rebellion.

6
00:00:15.350 --> 00:00:17.570
But that's just Hollywood magic.

7
00:00:17.570 --> 00:00:20.420
Artificial intelligence can
find a needle in a haystack,

8
00:00:20.420 --> 00:00:22.760
but it can't have a new idea.

9
00:00:22.760 --> 00:00:25.550
AI can discover a new
pattern of correlation,

10
00:00:25.550 --> 00:00:27.130
but it can't tell if that new pattern

11
00:00:27.130 --> 00:00:29.860
of correlation is interesting or useful.

12
00:00:29.860 --> 00:00:32.930
Artificial intelligence
can add two plus two,

13
00:00:32.930 --> 00:00:35.070
but it can't put two and two together.

14
00:00:35.070 --> 00:00:37.760
That ability is your superpower.

15
00:00:37.760 --> 00:00:41.240
Your superpower allows you to
take everything in your mind,

16
00:00:41.240 --> 00:00:43.300
your imagination, your
memory, your knowledge,

17
00:00:43.300 --> 00:00:47.180
your feelings, and apply
it all to a new problem.

18
00:00:47.180 --> 00:00:49.990
That's what we call integrated cognition.

19
00:00:49.990 --> 00:00:52.800
And it really is a super human power.

20
00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:55.480
I want to help you get
ahead and stay ahead with AI

21
00:00:55.480 --> 00:00:58.830
by understanding and
honing your superpower.

22
00:00:58.830 --> 00:01:01.600
First, I want you to have
a strong understanding

23
00:01:01.600 --> 00:01:04.180
of integrated cognition.

24
00:01:04.180 --> 00:01:06.840
Integrated cognition is all about learning

25
00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:09.960
from one area and applying it to another.

26
00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:12.440
Analogies are a really
good example of this.

27
00:01:12.440 --> 00:01:15.200
We use analogies a lot
in human communication

28
00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:18.480
because it allows us to
condense information.

29
00:01:18.480 --> 00:01:21.550
That new restaurant is like
my favorite Mexican place

30
00:01:21.550 --> 00:01:24.270
with great bar and live music.

31
00:01:24.270 --> 00:01:26.270
Or that new Netflix series

32
00:01:26.270 --> 00:01:28.130
is like "Game of Thrones" without dragons.

33
00:01:28.130 --> 00:01:30.940
Or driving a Tesla is like
riding on a magic car,

34
00:01:30.940 --> 00:01:34.570
but until you ask it to drive itself.

35
00:01:34.570 --> 00:01:38.890
We take learning from all areas
and apply it to every other.

36
00:01:38.890 --> 00:01:42.330
Your worldview has been
crafted over a whole lifetime

37
00:01:42.330 --> 00:01:43.950
of learning and experience.

38
00:01:43.950 --> 00:01:46.290
All the books you've read,
the movies you've seen,

39
00:01:46.290 --> 00:01:48.610
the meetings you've been
in, all blend together

40
00:01:48.610 --> 00:01:51.340
in this wondrous
interpretation of the world

41
00:01:51.340 --> 00:01:53.850
that is yours and yours alone.

42
00:01:53.850 --> 00:01:56.450
When you bring all of that to the table,

43
00:01:56.450 --> 00:02:00.690
you are adding a very unique
ingredient to the conversation.

44
00:02:00.690 --> 00:02:03.930
So practice open-mindedness,

45
00:02:03.930 --> 00:02:06.170
be curious to hear what others think,

46
00:02:06.170 --> 00:02:08.160
explore new avenues for learning

47
00:02:08.160 --> 00:02:11.520
and be open to new experiences and ideas.

48
00:02:11.520 --> 00:02:15.320
You never know when that
intel might come in handy.

49
00:02:15.320 --> 00:02:20.560
Another element of integrated
cognition is collaboration.

50
00:02:20.560 --> 00:02:22.940
When you put your unique perspective

51
00:02:22.940 --> 00:02:24.730
and your integrated cognition

52
00:02:24.730 --> 00:02:26.900
into a room with a dozen others

53
00:02:26.900 --> 00:02:29.840
who have all had a completely
different worldview

54
00:02:29.840 --> 00:02:33.920
built on their own unique lives,
that's when the sparks fly,

55
00:02:33.920 --> 00:02:36.300
that's collaboration at its best.

56
00:02:36.300 --> 00:02:39.580
Your ability to work with
others and enhance their ideas

57
00:02:39.580 --> 00:02:42.240
cannot be duplicated by a machine.

58
00:02:42.240 --> 00:02:43.900
Your ability to use empathy,

59
00:02:43.900 --> 00:02:45.800
to put yourself in another person's shoes,

60
00:02:45.800 --> 00:02:48.150
your capacity to accept new ideas

61
00:02:48.150 --> 00:02:51.010
and allow yourself to question
your fundamental beliefs,

62
00:02:51.010 --> 00:02:55.220
even for just a moment, will
make you an invaluable player

63
00:02:55.220 --> 00:02:59.560
in a world filled with artificial
intelligence applications.

64
00:02:59.560 --> 00:03:02.370
So ask people to challenge your ideas.

65
00:03:02.370 --> 00:03:06.120
Listen, try and see things
from a different point of view.

66
00:03:06.120 --> 00:03:11.380
That's a uniquely human skill,
but you need to practice.

67
00:03:11.380 --> 00:03:13.020
When you're putting together a team

68
00:03:13.020 --> 00:03:15.270
to brainstorm or solve a problem,

69
00:03:15.270 --> 00:03:17.150
make sure you have as diverse a group

70
00:03:17.150 --> 00:03:19.890
of people in the room as you can.

71
00:03:19.890 --> 00:03:22.560
Race, gender, age, nationality.

72
00:03:22.560 --> 00:03:25.300
The more variety of
worldviews in the room,

73
00:03:25.300 --> 00:03:27.900
the richer the conversation,
the more comprehensive

74
00:03:27.900 --> 00:03:30.140
and sophisticated the discussion,

75
00:03:30.140 --> 00:03:33.350
and the more valuable the outcome.

76
00:03:33.350 --> 00:03:34.910
I want you to find opportunities

77
00:03:34.910 --> 00:03:37.820
to hone your human superpowers.

78
00:03:37.820 --> 00:03:39.740
Next time you have a new team member,

79
00:03:39.740 --> 00:03:41.920
be curious to get to know them.

80
00:03:41.920 --> 00:03:43.620
When you make a presentation,

81
00:03:43.620 --> 00:03:46.430
ask people to challenge your ideas.

82
00:03:46.430 --> 00:03:47.740
When you're troubleshooting,

83
00:03:47.740 --> 00:03:49.710
try to see things from a different angle

84
00:03:49.710 --> 00:03:52.350
or a whole different point of view.

85
00:03:52.350 --> 00:03:55.750
You'll go far, once you
understand that having new ideas

86
00:03:55.750 --> 00:03:58.100
and seeing things from
a different perspective

87
00:03:58.100 --> 00:03:59.410
beats the heck out of finding

88
00:03:59.410 --> 00:04:01.913
that needle in a haystack every time.
