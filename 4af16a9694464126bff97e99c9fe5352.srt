00:00:00.360 --> 00:00:01.760
- Computers are getting really good

2
00:00:01.760 --> 00:00:04.190
at their ability to recognize speech.

3
00:00:04.190 --> 00:00:07.530
No, wait, I didn't say rec a nice beach.

4
00:00:07.530 --> 00:00:08.810
That's where Natural Language Processing

5
00:00:08.810 --> 00:00:11.950
is one of the pillars of
artificial intelligence.

6
00:00:11.950 --> 00:00:14.820
And you can take advantage
of it once you get a feel

7
00:00:14.820 --> 00:00:18.050
for what it is and how it
can be used for marketing.

8
00:00:18.050 --> 00:00:21.960
Natural Language Processing
includes speech recognition,

9
00:00:21.960 --> 00:00:25.190
understanding that this
(clapping) is just noise,

10
00:00:25.190 --> 00:00:27.920
and that these words are speech.

11
00:00:27.920 --> 00:00:31.080
And then transferring that speech to text

12
00:00:31.080 --> 00:00:34.770
so you can dictate texts
or searches in your phone,

13
00:00:34.770 --> 00:00:37.060
and text comprehension,

14
00:00:37.060 --> 00:00:40.250
the art of figuring out
what your words mean.

15
00:00:40.250 --> 00:00:42.410
And finally sentiment analysis,

16
00:00:42.410 --> 00:00:45.630
the art of figuring out how you feel.

17
00:00:45.630 --> 00:00:47.660
Then there's the problem of slang.

18
00:00:47.660 --> 00:00:51.810
If a teenager says that movie
was sick, it's a winner.

19
00:00:51.810 --> 00:00:54.950
But if my 92 year old father says that,

20
00:00:54.950 --> 00:00:57.090
the movie had too much violence in it.

21
00:00:57.090 --> 00:01:00.800
So where is Natural Language
Processing useful in marketing?

22
00:01:00.800 --> 00:01:03.190
It can capture what your customers say

23
00:01:03.190 --> 00:01:04.930
when they talk to you.

24
00:01:04.930 --> 00:01:08.200
You can capture every word over
the phone in the call center

25
00:01:08.200 --> 00:01:12.220
then analyze the call log
for what upsets them the most

26
00:01:12.220 --> 00:01:16.000
or uncover which of your
competitors they ask about.

27
00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:17.880
Wouldn't it be great if you could find out

28
00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:19.370
which product features your customers

29
00:01:19.370 --> 00:01:21.350
complain about the most?

30
00:01:21.350 --> 00:01:22.580
You can.

31
00:01:22.580 --> 00:01:24.720
Natural language
processing is also valuable

32
00:01:24.720 --> 00:01:26.580
for tracking social media.

33
00:01:26.580 --> 00:01:29.500
It can find all the times
people mentioned your company

34
00:01:29.500 --> 00:01:33.060
or product, and based on
positive or negative words,

35
00:01:33.060 --> 00:01:36.590
tell you if people are mostly
happy or getting more unhappy,

36
00:01:36.590 --> 00:01:39.070
same with how they feel
about your competitors.

37
00:01:39.070 --> 00:01:42.580
Natural Language Processing
is speech recognition

38
00:01:42.580 --> 00:01:46.390
that translates speech to
text and then text to meaning.

39
00:01:46.390 --> 00:01:49.700
This is text analysis with smarts.

40
00:01:49.700 --> 00:01:51.600
Natural language processing can analyze

41
00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:54.090
thousands of internal company emails,

42
00:01:54.090 --> 00:01:56.420
marketplace publications,
academic treatises,

43
00:01:56.420 --> 00:01:59.040
and give you specific information

44
00:01:59.040 --> 00:02:00.800
rather than just a list of documents

45
00:02:00.800 --> 00:02:04.180
that might include something
that you're looking for.

46
00:02:04.180 --> 00:02:06.930
By reading all internal emails,

47
00:02:06.930 --> 00:02:09.800
the computer can figure out
who in your organization

48
00:02:09.800 --> 00:02:12.730
gets the most questions
and has the most answers

49
00:02:12.730 --> 00:02:14.950
about a particular topic.

50
00:02:14.950 --> 00:02:17.690
It can reveal the important
passages in newspapers

51
00:02:17.690 --> 00:02:20.350
and journals when you're
researching a new ad campaign

52
00:02:20.350 --> 00:02:23.760
or the competition or marketplace trends.

53
00:02:23.760 --> 00:02:27.180
Natural Language Processing
can compare your blog posts

54
00:02:27.180 --> 00:02:30.030
and your white papers to your competitors

55
00:02:30.030 --> 00:02:33.270
and make recommendations
about how to improve appeal,

56
00:02:33.270 --> 00:02:36.180
readability and Google ranking.

57
00:02:36.180 --> 00:02:40.700
This is search engine
optimization on steroids.

58
00:02:40.700 --> 00:02:42.450
So where would Natural Language Processing

59
00:02:42.450 --> 00:02:44.130
help you the most?

60
00:02:44.130 --> 00:02:45.510
Think about areas in your company

61
00:02:45.510 --> 00:02:47.340
where you have a lot of texts.

62
00:02:47.340 --> 00:02:49.070
Think about places
where it would be useful

63
00:02:49.070 --> 00:02:51.070
to have the computer read and understand

64
00:02:51.070 --> 00:02:53.390
a huge number of pages.

65
00:02:53.390 --> 00:02:55.360
Think about the insights
that you could uncover

66
00:02:55.360 --> 00:02:56.830
if only you had a system

67
00:02:56.830 --> 00:02:58.870
that could read through
all of those reports,

68
00:02:58.870 --> 00:03:00.680
or all of those survey results,

69
00:03:00.680 --> 00:03:03.010
or all of those feedback forms.

70
00:03:03.010 --> 00:03:06.810
Think about keeping tabs on
whether the talk on social media

71
00:03:06.810 --> 00:03:09.460
about you is good or bad.

72
00:03:09.460 --> 00:03:11.220
When you have that list of the ways

73
00:03:11.220 --> 00:03:13.470
that Natural Language Processing can help,

74
00:03:13.470 --> 00:03:16.920
score each one for how
valuable it would be.

75
00:03:16.920 --> 00:03:19.620
At that point, you're ready to investigate

76
00:03:19.620 --> 00:03:22.890
how hard each one would be to accomplish

77
00:03:22.890 --> 00:03:24.740
and how long each one would take.

78
00:03:24.740 --> 00:03:28.160
Do that and you can
easily see which projects

79
00:03:28.160 --> 00:03:31.810
are worth the effort and
which to tackle first.

80
00:03:31.810 --> 00:03:33.883
Alexa, turn off the lights.
