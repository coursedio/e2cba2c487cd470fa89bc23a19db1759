00:00:00.260 --> 00:00:02.350
- If you're doing any online advertising,

2
00:00:02.350 --> 00:00:04.630
you might already be
using machine learning

3
00:00:04.630 --> 00:00:06.120
and just not know it.

4
00:00:06.120 --> 00:00:08.890
Programmatic advertising is the norm today

5
00:00:08.890 --> 00:00:11.320
because the enormous
volume of ads on Google

6
00:00:11.320 --> 00:00:13.460
and Facebook and Twitter and all the rest.

7
00:00:13.460 --> 00:00:16.730
Once you understand how machine
learning alters the process,

8
00:00:16.730 --> 00:00:19.400
you can make better use of
programmatic advertising

9
00:00:19.400 --> 00:00:22.500
and get better results for your ads.

10
00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:23.500
In the good old days,

11
00:00:23.500 --> 00:00:25.390
you'd check off the traits of the audience

12
00:00:25.390 --> 00:00:26.330
you were targeting,

13
00:00:26.330 --> 00:00:29.400
age, gender, location, education,

14
00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:32.170
and the publishers
computer would show your ad

15
00:00:32.170 --> 00:00:34.090
to the person with those traits.

16
00:00:34.090 --> 00:00:38.040
Programmatic means that the
system does the matching,

17
00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:40.120
which is huge because the average person

18
00:00:40.120 --> 00:00:43.110
sees something like 5,000 ads everyday.

19
00:00:43.110 --> 00:00:45.570
Multiply that by half the
population on the planet,

20
00:00:45.570 --> 00:00:48.400
and it's a lot of ads to serve.

21
00:00:48.400 --> 00:00:51.540
It's more efficient for
you, the advertiser,

22
00:00:51.540 --> 00:00:55.210
to go to an intermediary, an ad exchange,

23
00:00:55.210 --> 00:00:58.000
and let them figure out
where to place your ad

24
00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:00.260
based on your desired audience traits.

25
00:01:00.260 --> 00:01:03.320
You get to choose how much
you're willing to pay per ad,

26
00:01:03.320 --> 00:01:04.700
bidding against others,

27
00:01:04.700 --> 00:01:07.620
and how much you're
willing to spend per day,

28
00:01:07.620 --> 00:01:08.880
budget control,

29
00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:11.430
and the computers work out the details.

30
00:01:11.430 --> 00:01:13.260
With machine learning,

31
00:01:13.260 --> 00:01:16.820
you do not choose the audience traits.

32
00:01:16.820 --> 00:01:19.740
You choose the desired outcome.

33
00:01:19.740 --> 00:01:22.620
You might want your ad to
generate more click throughs

34
00:01:22.620 --> 00:01:25.410
to measure response and awareness

35
00:01:25.410 --> 00:01:28.350
or more page views on your site
because you sell advertising

36
00:01:28.350 --> 00:01:32.900
or more people signing up for
your newsletter or more sales.

37
00:01:32.900 --> 00:01:35.190
You ask for the outcome,

38
00:01:35.190 --> 00:01:38.070
then you let the machine
learning algorithm figure out

39
00:01:38.070 --> 00:01:39.540
how to make that happen.

40
00:01:39.540 --> 00:01:42.180
The algorithm will try
a variety of your ads

41
00:01:42.180 --> 00:01:44.920
to see which ones work
on which types of people.

42
00:01:44.920 --> 00:01:46.840
Now, the interesting part

43
00:01:46.840 --> 00:01:51.120
is that types of people are not logical.

44
00:01:51.120 --> 00:01:53.690
Women between 18 and 34 in suburbs,

45
00:01:53.690 --> 00:01:56.120
whom you think might like your minivan,

46
00:01:56.120 --> 00:01:58.670
instead, there are
people who have something

47
00:01:58.670 --> 00:02:00.960
statistically in common with those

48
00:02:00.960 --> 00:02:03.020
who performed the desired outcome.

49
00:02:03.020 --> 00:02:05.390
It's not logical, it's mathematical.

50
00:02:05.390 --> 00:02:08.340
It might not make sense that the people

51
00:02:08.340 --> 00:02:11.280
who have this type of computer
and that kind of browser

52
00:02:11.280 --> 00:02:13.150
and read articles about ponies

53
00:02:13.150 --> 00:02:14.810
before eight o'clock in the morning

54
00:02:14.810 --> 00:02:17.200
are the most likely to buy a minivan.

55
00:02:17.200 --> 00:02:20.430
But if they are, the algorithm makes note

56
00:02:20.430 --> 00:02:23.800
and finds others like them
and shows them your ad.

57
00:02:23.800 --> 00:02:25.890
Because this is artificial intelligence,

58
00:02:25.890 --> 00:02:28.470
that combination of traits and behaviors

59
00:02:28.470 --> 00:02:30.140
is not written in stone,

60
00:02:30.140 --> 00:02:34.070
instead, it is continuously
updated profiles

61
00:02:34.070 --> 00:02:37.560
of micro segments of your target audience,

62
00:02:37.560 --> 00:02:41.290
and there might be hundreds
or thousands of micro segments

63
00:02:41.290 --> 00:02:45.000
being monitored and
advertised to at any time.

64
00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:46.950
So instead of wasting time trying to guess

65
00:02:46.950 --> 00:02:49.470
what kind of person might respond,

66
00:02:49.470 --> 00:02:52.410
start thinking about the
different kinds of messages

67
00:02:52.410 --> 00:02:55.360
that might resonate with
different kinds of people,

68
00:02:55.360 --> 00:02:57.340
create a variety of ads

69
00:02:57.340 --> 00:03:00.120
for the machine to show the whole world

70
00:03:00.120 --> 00:03:02.190
and let the algorithm sort out

71
00:03:02.190 --> 00:03:04.370
where you should spend your money.

72
00:03:04.370 --> 00:03:06.310
That's how you take
advantage of machine learning

73
00:03:06.310 --> 00:03:07.773
and programmatic advertising.
